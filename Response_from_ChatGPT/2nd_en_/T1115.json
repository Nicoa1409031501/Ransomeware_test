This technique involves modifying the Security Support Provider registry entries, which requires administrative privileges and access to the Windows Registry.\n\nTo implement this technique, you would need to be able to modify registry entries and have administrative access to the system. However, as a virtual assistant program running in a restricted environment, such actions are not feasible.\n\nYou may consider seeking assistance from the system administrator or running the code on an appropriate system with the necessary privileges."
