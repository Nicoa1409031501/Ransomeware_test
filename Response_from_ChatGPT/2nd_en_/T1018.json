Method 1: Using the Python `requests` library\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)  # Send a GET request to the specified URL\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            print(\"Website reached successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Website unreachable.\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndrive_by_compromise(\"https://example.com\")\n```\nPackage Used: requests\n\n2. Method 2: Using the Python `urllib` library\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    try:\n        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)  # Open the URL\n        if response.getcode() == 200:\n            print(\"Website reached successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Website unreachable.\")\n    except urllib.error.URLError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e.reason}\")\n\ndrive_by_compromise(\"https://example.com\")\n```\nPackage Used: urllib\n\n3. Method 3: Using the Python `http.client` library\n\n```python\nimport http.client\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    try:\n        conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(url)  # Create an HTTPS connection\n        conn.request(\"GET\", \"/\")  # Send a GET request\n        response = conn.getresponse()  # Get the response\n        if response.status == 200:\n            print(\"Website reached successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Website unreachable.\")\n    except http.client.HTTPException as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\ndrive_by_compromise(\"example.com\")\n```\nPackage Used: http.client\n\nEach of the methods above can be executed by calling the respective function: `drive_by_compromise(\"https://example.com\")`. Replace the URL with the desired website to test.\n\nPlease note that the code snippet provided only checks if the website is reachable and returns a status code. It does not perform any actual malicious activity associated with a drive-by compromise. Use it responsibly and only on websites that you have appropriate permission to test."
