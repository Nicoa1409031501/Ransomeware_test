Import the ldap3 package.\n2. Set up the LDAP connection with the target directory service using appropriate connection parameters (e.g., server address, port number, user credentials).\n3. Bind to the directory service with the provided user credentials.\n4. Use the connection object to search for and retrieve directory entries based on specified filters and attributes.\n5. Process and utilize the retrieved directory information as needed.\n6. Close the LDAP connection when finished.\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: pyad, python-ldap\n\n1. Import the pyad and python-ldap packages.\n2. Connect to the target Active Directory using appropriate connection parameters (e.g., server address, port number, user credentials).\n3. Use the provided user credentials to bind to the directory service.\n4. Perform operations such as searching for and retrieving directory entries.\n5. Process and utilize the retrieved directory information as needed.\n6. Close the directory connection when finished.\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: ldap3\n\n1. Import the ldap3 package.\n2.
