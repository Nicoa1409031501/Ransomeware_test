Using the csv module:\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef read_csv_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as csv_file:\n        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)\n        for row in csv_reader:\n            print(row)\n\nread_csv_file('path/to/file.csv')\n```\n\n2. Using the pandas library:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef read_csv_file(file_path):\n    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    print(df)\n\nread_csv_file('path/to/file.csv')\n```\n\n3. Using the built-in open function and splitting lines:\n```python\ndef read_csv_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as csv_file:\n        lines = csv_file.read().splitlines()\n        for line in lines:\n            data = line.split(',')\n            print(data)\n\nread_csv_file('path/to/file.csv')\n```\n\nIn these implementations, three different methods were used to read a CSV file and print its contents: the csv module, the pandas library, and the built-in open function. The csv module and pandas library provide more advanced features for handling and manipulating CSV data, while the open function offers a basic approach.\n\nPlease replace `'path/to/file.csv'` with the actual file path to be used. Additionally, these implementations only read the file and print its contents, but you can modify the code to perform any required data manipulation or validation.\n\nNo files are written in this implementation."
