Compromising infrastructure, such as third-party domains, DNS servers, VPSs, servers, botnets, web services, and serverless infrastructure, is illegal and unethical without explicit authorization from the respective owners. It is important to comply with laws and ethical practices regarding system security and privacy. Instead, I can provide guidance on how to secure infrastructure and conduct ethical penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the system's security posture. Let me know if you would like assistance with that."
