Implement the out-of-band testing using Bluetooth:\n```python\ndef bluetooth_testing():\n    # Scan for available Bluetooth devices\n    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()\n\n    # Perform tests on each discovered device\n    for device_address in nearby_devices:\n        device_name = bluetooth.lookup_name(device_address)\n        # Perform specific tests on the device\n        # ...\n\n        # Log the test results\n        print(f\"Device: {device_name} ({device_address})\")\n        # ...\n\n# Call the function to perform Bluetooth testing\nbluetooth_testing()\n```\n\n3. Implement the out-of-band testing using radio frequency (RF) communication:\n```python\ndef rf_testing():\n    # Configure and initialize the radio module\n    radio.config(channel=42, power=7)\n    radio.on()\n\n    # Scan for nearby devices using RF\n    nearby_devices = radio.scan()\n\n    # Perform tests on each discovered device\n    for device_address in nearby_devices:\n        device_name = radio.get_device_name(device_address)\n        # Perform specific tests on the device\n        # ...\n\n        # Log the test results\n        print(f\"Device: {device_name} ({device_address})\")\n        # ...\n\n# Call the function to perform RF testing\nrf_testing()\n```\n\nNote: The above code snippets demonstrate the basic structure for performing out-of-band testing using Bluetooth and radio frequency. However, the specific tests and functionalities to be implemented will depend on the program or device being tested and its interaction with Bluetooth or RF technologies. Please modify the code accordingly to match the requirements of the testing plan."
