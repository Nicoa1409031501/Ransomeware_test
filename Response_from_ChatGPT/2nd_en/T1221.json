Advantage: Uses a well-established library for working with Microsoft Word documents.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires parsing and modifying the XML content of the document, which may be complex for complex document structures.\n3. Disadvantage: Limited flexibility in injecting code into specific locations within the document.\n[Score]: 8\n\n[Solution 2]\nPackages used: zipfile, xml.etree.ElementTree\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Modifies the document by directly manipulating the XML content within the .docx file, providing more control over the injection location.\n2. Advantage: Uses built-in Python libraries, minimizing external dependencies.\n3. Disadvantage: Requires manually parsing and updating the XML content, which can be more error-prone.\n[Score]: 7\n\n[Solution 3]\nPackages used: python-docx-template\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Provides a templating mechanism for generating Word documents, making it easier to inject dynamic content.\n2. Advantage: Allows injecting code at specific locations using placeholders/variables defined within the template.\n3. Disadvantage: May require modifying the document structure to add the necessary placeholders for injection.\n[Score]: 9\n\nSince Solution 3 scored over 8, let's proceed to write functional test and unit test code for that solution.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1221-Template Injection]\n\n[Solution 3 Unit Test]\nFunctional Test:\n\n```python\nfrom docx import Document\n\ndef test_template_injection_attack():\n    # Create a test Word document with placeholders for injection\n    doc = Document()\n    doc.add_paragraph(\"Hello, ${name}! This is a test document.\")\n\n    # Save the test document\n    test_file_path = \"test_document.docx\"\n    doc.save(test_file_path)\n\n    # Perform the template injection attack\n    template_injection_attack(test_file_path, '<w:r><w:t>Malicious code</w:t></w:r>')\n\n    # Read the modified document\n    modified_doc = Document(test_file_path)\n    \n    # Verify that the injection was successful by checking if the injected code is present\n    for paragraph in modified_doc.paragraphs:\n        if \"Malicious code\" in paragraph.text:\n            print(\"Injection successful.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"Injection failed.\")\n\n# Run the functional test\ntest_template_injection_attack()\n```\n\nIn the functional test, we create a test Word document with a placeholder for injection. We then save the document, perform the template injection attack using the chosen method (Solution 3), and finally validate if the injected code is present in the modified document.\n\nPlease note that the `template_injection_attack` function is the same as the one provided in Method 3."
