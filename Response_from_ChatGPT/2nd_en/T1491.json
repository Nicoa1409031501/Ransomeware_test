As an AI language model, I don't have access to the actual environment and system configurations to provide a code solution for this technique. The implementation of execution guardrails heavily depends on the specific environment, security policies, and technical controls in place.\n\nTo implement execution guardrails, it requires a deep understanding of the environment, the execution platforms, and the available security controls. Therefore, without access to the actual environment and system configurations, it is not feasible to provide a code solution for this technique. It is recommended to consult with security professionals or follow best practices and guidelines provided by security frameworks or vendors to implement execution guardrails effectively."
