Utilizes web scraping to gather employee names and email addresses.\n  2. Flexible and customizable for different website structures.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Relies on the specific structure and class names of the target website.\n  2. May require regular maintenance if the target website structure changes.\n- Score: 8\n\n[SOLUTION 2]\n- Used Packages: requests, json\n- Input Files: None\n- Output Files: None\n- Correctness of Syntax and Logic: The code appears to be syntactically correct and logically sound.\n- Advantages:\n  1. Accesses an API to gather employee names and email addresses.\n  2. Can be easily adapted to work with different APIs.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Relies on the availability and structure of the API.\n  2. Requires knowledge of the specific API endpoints and data structure.\n- Score: 7\n\n[SOLUTION 3]\n- Used Packages: subprocess\n- Input Files: None\n- Output Files: credentials.txt\n- Correctness of Syntax and Logic: The code appears to be syntactically correct and logically sound.\n- Advantages:\n  1. Uses a credential dumping tool to gather credentials.\n  2. Can be effective for retrieving sensitive information.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Requires the installation and setup of a credential dumping tool.\n  2. May not be suitable for all environments or scenarios.\n- Score: 7\n\nFunctional and Unit Testing Code will be written for Solution 1 as it scored the highest. [Solution 1 Unit Test]"
