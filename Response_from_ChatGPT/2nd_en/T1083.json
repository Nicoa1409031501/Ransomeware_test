Advantage: The os module is a standard library in Python, so no additional package installation is required.\n2. Disadvantage: The os.walk() function can be slow for large directories with many files and subdirectories.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: glob\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The glob module provides a simple and concise way to search for files and directories using wildcard patterns.\n2. Advantage: The glob() function in glob module is efficient and performs well, even for large directories.\n3. Disadvantage: The glob module does not provide a way to handle complex directory tree traversal or filtering based on other criteria.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 10\nUsed packages: pathlib\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The pathlib module provides an object-oriented and platform-independent approach to handle file system paths.\n2. Advantage: The Path class in pathlib module offers a rich set of methods for working with files and directories.\n3. Advantage: The pathlib module is available in Python 3.4 and above by default.\n4. Disadvantage: The pathlib module may require a bit of learning curve for developers unfamiliar with its API.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution 3 using the pathlib module scores the highest and demonstrates the advantages of an object-oriented approach for file and directory discovery."
