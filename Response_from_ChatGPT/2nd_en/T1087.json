Simple implementation using the subprocess module to execute commands and capture output.\n3. Easy to understand and modify.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. May require additional parsing and filtering of the output to extract the desired account information.\n2. Relies on the availability of the \"net user\" and \"net user /domain\" commands on the system.\n3. The email and cloud account parts are not implemented and will need to be customized and integrated separately.\n\n[Score]: 7\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Feasible]\n[T1087 - Account Discovery]\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Relies on Python packages like \"subprocess\" and \"win32com.client\" for more advanced functionality.\n2. Allows for direct access to Exchange address lists and Azure cloud accounts.\n3. Provides more flexibility in retrieving account information.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Requires the \"subprocess\" package to execute commands and may have platform dependency.\n2. The code for accessing Exchange address lists and Azure cloud accounts may require additional setup and configuration.\n\n[Score]: 8\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Cannot be Implemented in the Current Environment]\n[T1087 - Account Discovery]\n\nExplanation:\nThe implementation using external Python packages (Win32com for Exchange address lists and Azure SDK for cloud accounts) requires additional dependencies and access to specific systems (Exchange server and Azure). Since the current environment does not have these systems available, this solution cannot be implemented.\n\n[Score]: 0"
