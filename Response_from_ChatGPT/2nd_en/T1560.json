Uses built-in libraries, so no need to install additional packages.\n  2. Compresses and encrypts the data in a single function call.\n- Disadvantages: \n  1. XOR encryption in Method 3 may not provide strong security.\n  2. No error handling or validation of input parameters.\n  3. May have performance issues with large data sets.\n\n[Score]: 7\n\nSolution 2: \nUsed packages: \n- py7zr\n- cryptography\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n- Advantages: \n  1. Uses established libraries for compression and encryption.\n  2. py7zr provides a convenient way to compress data into a 7z archive.\n  3. cryptography library provides strong encryption algorithms.\n- Disadvantages: \n  1. Requires installation of additional packages.\n  2. Temporary file is created during compression process.\n  3. No error handling or validation of input parameters.\n\n[Score]: 8\n\nSolution 3:\nAdvantages: \n- Advantages: \n  1. No package dependencies.\n  2. Simple implementation.\n- Disadvantages: \n  1. XOR encryption may not provide strong security.\n  2. No error handling or validation of input parameters.\n\n[Score]: 6\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 2 has the highest score and will proceed with writing the unit test code."
