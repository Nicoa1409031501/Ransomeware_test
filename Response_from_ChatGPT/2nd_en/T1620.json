        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: ctypes, windll.kernel32\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the ctypes package to directly interface with the Windows API, making it platform-specific to Windows.\n2. Disadvantage: It may be less portable to other operating systems or require additional modifications to work.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: Python C API\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the Python C API, allowing fine-grained control over memory allocation and execution.\n2. Disadvantage: It requires creating a Python extension module, which may add complexity to the codebase.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: struct\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the standard struct module in Python, making it simple and platform-independent.\n2. Disadvantage: The memory manipulation technique used may not be as efficient or reliable as the previous solutions.\n\nConsidering the scores, Solution 2 has the highest score of 9 and therefore will proceed with writing functional test and unit test code for Solution 2."
