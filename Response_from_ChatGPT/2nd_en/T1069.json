        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: os, subprocess\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Uses built-in modules of Python, so no additional package installation required.\n2. Advantage: Provides a comprehensive solution for discovering both local system groups and domain-level groups and permissions.\n3. Disadvantage: Relies on the 'net localgroup' and 'net group' commands, which may have different output formats on different systems.\n4. Advantage: The code is concise and easy to understand.\n5. Advantage: Correct syntax and logic.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: subprocess\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Uses the 'subprocess' module to execute the 'net group' command, allowing discovery of domain-level groups and permissions.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires the 'subprocess' module, but it is a built-in module and should be available on most systems.\n3. Advantage: The code is concise and easy to understand.\n4. Disadvantage: Relies on the 'net group' command, which may have different output formats on different systems.\n5. Advantage: Correct syntax and logic.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: requests\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Retrieves group and user information from a cloud API.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires the 'requests' module, which may need to be installed using pip.\n3. Advantage: Can be easily modified to work with any cloud API endpoint.\n4. Advantage: The code is concise and easy to understand.\n5. Advantage: Correct syntax and logic.\n\nSince Solution 1 scored above 8, I will continue to write functional and unit test code for that solution."
