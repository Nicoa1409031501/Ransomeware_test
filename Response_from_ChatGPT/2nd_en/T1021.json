Advantages:\n   - paramiko package provides a secure SSH client implementation.\n   - Allows for remote execution of commands on a remote server.\n   - Supports authentication with passwords or SSH keys.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires SSH access to the remote server.\n   - Limited to remote servers that support SSH.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: pyodbc\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - pyodbc package provides a flexible and efficient interface for interacting with databases.\n   - Can be used to execute queries on remote network shares using SMB.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires access to the remote network share.\n   - Requires knowledge of the share name, username, and password.\n   - Limited to systems that support SMB.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: pywinrm\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - pywinrm package provides a Python interface for interacting with remote systems using WinRM.\n   - Allows for remote execution of commands on Windows systems.\n   - Supports authentication with usernames and passwords.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires WinRM to be enabled and accessible on the remote system.\n   - Limited to Windows systems that support WinRM.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution 1 using paramiko package for SSH has the highest score of 9. Therefore, we will proceed to write functional test and unit test code for that solution.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1021-Remote Services]\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\n\nTo write the functional test for Solution 1, we will create a function that demonstrates the usage of the `ssh_remote_control` function:\n\n```python\ndef test_ssh_remote_control():\n    host = 'remote-host'\n    username = 'username'\n    password = 'password'\n    command = 'ls -l'\n\n    ssh_remote_control(host, username, password, command)\n```\n\nTo write the unit test for Solution 1, we will test the `ssh_remote_control` function using a mock SSH server:\n\n```python\nimport paramiko\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\ndef test_ssh_remote_control():\n    host = 'mock-server'\n    username = 'mock-username'\n    password = 'mock-password'\n    command = 'ls -l'\n    \n    # Mock the SSH connection\n    with patch('paramiko.SSHClient') as mock_ssh_client:\n        mock_client = mock_ssh_client.return_value\n        mock_exec_command = mock_client.exec_command.return_value\n        \n        # Mock the output\n        mock_stdout = mock_exec_command[1]\n        mock_stdout.read.return_value = b'mock-output'\n        \n        # Test the function\n        ssh_remote_control(host, username, password, command)\n        \n        # Verify the SSH connection is called with the correct parameters\n        mock_ssh_client.assert_called_once()\n        mock_client.connect.assert_called_with(\n            host, username=username, password=password)\n        \n        # Verify the command is executed and the output is printed\n        mock_client.exec_command.assert_called_with(command)\n        mock_stdout.read.assert_called_once()\n```\n\nNow we have written the functional test and unit test code for Solution 1 of T1021-Remote Services using the paramiko package."
