Advantages:\n   - Utilizes built-in functionality of the operating system.\n   - Easy to configure and implement.\n   - No additional packages or libraries required.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Limited flexibility compared to other methods.\n   - Can only run scripts during system boot or user logon.\n   - Limited cross-platform compatibility.\n\n[Score]: 7\n\n[Solution 2]\nPackages Used: None\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Provides flexibility to execute scripts at either system boot or user logon.\n   - Can execute scripts remotely using Group Policy in Windows.\n   - Supports cross-platform compatibility.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires administrative access to configure Group Policy settings.\n   - May impact system performance during logon due to script execution.\n   - More complex to implement compared to other methods.\n\n[Score]: 8\n\n[Solution 3]\nPackages Used: None\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Allows execution of scripts during system boot.\n   - Provides more control and customization options.\n   - Can be used on Unix-like systems.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires root/administrator access to modify RC scripts.\n   - Limited cross-platform compatibility.\n   - Any errors in the script can potentially impact system stability.\n\n[Score]: 6\n\nSince Solution 2 scored over 8, we will proceed with writing functional and unit tests for it."
