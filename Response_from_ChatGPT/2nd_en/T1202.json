Advantage: The subprocess module provides a flexible way to spawn new processes and execute commands. It allows for more granular control over the launched process.\n2. Advantage: The shell parameter set to True in the Popen function allows the command to be executed indirectly, providing additional security.\n3. Advantage: This method is widely supported across different platforms.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: os\nInput and output files: None\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The os module provides a way to execute system commands. It is a built-in module and does not require any additional package installation.\n2. Disadvantage: The os.system function does not allow for as much control over the launched process compared to subprocess.\n3. Advantage: This method is widely supported across different platforms.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: ctypes\nInput and output files: None\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The ctypes module is a powerful library for interacting with dynamic libraries written in C. It allows for fine-grained control over process creation.\n2. Disadvantage: The usage of ctypes in this context may require more knowledge of C APIs and may be more complex compared to the other methods.\n3. Advantage: This method is widely supported across different platforms.\n\nThe scores are assigned based on the given criteria. The deductions are as follows:\n1. Deduct 5 points for syntax and logical errors: None\n2. Deduct 2 points for each other error or disadvantage: None\n\nFor T1202-Indirect Command Execution, the highest score is 9, which belongs to Solution 1. We will proceed to write functional and unit tests for Solution 1."
