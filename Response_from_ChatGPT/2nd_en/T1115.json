Advantage: The pyperclip package provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to access the clipboard data.\n2. Disadvantage: This solution may not work on all operating systems, as pyperclip relies on OS-specific clipboard access methods.\n3. Score: 8\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: tkinter\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The tkinter package is built-in to Python, so no additional installation is required.\n2. Disadvantage: This solution creates a temporary window, which may be undesirable in some scenarios.\n3. Disadvantage: The tkinter solution may not work on headless servers or in environments without a graphical display.\n4. Score: 6\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Cannot be Implemented in the Current Environment]\nThis solution cannot be implemented in the current environment, as it requires user interaction with the simulated keyboard hotkey press.\n\nNext, I will write the functional test and unit test code for the first solution."
