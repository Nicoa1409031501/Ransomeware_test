Advantage: The base64 encoding and decoding functions are readily available in the base64 package, making it easy to implement data obfuscation.\n2. Disadvantage: This method only provides minimal obfuscation as anyone familiar with base64 can easily decode the data.\n3. Score: 8\n\n[Solution 2]\nScore: 7\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This method utilizes steganography techniques to hide data within image files, providing stronger obfuscation compared to simple base64 encoding.\n2. Disadvantage: The availability of steganography tools and their integration into the system may be a challenge.\n3. Disadvantage: The subprocess module may introduce security risks if not used carefully.\n4. Score: 7\n\n[Solution 3]\nScore: 9\nUsed packages: requests\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This method leverages custom HTTP headers to send the command, making it appear as a legitimate protocol request.\n2. Advantage: It is relatively easy to implement and does not require additional tools.\n3. Disadvantage: The effectiveness of this method depends on the security mechanisms in place on the receiving end, as some security solutions may flag or block suspicious custom headers.\n4. Score: 9\n\nSince Solution 3 has the highest score of 9, I will proceed to write functional and unit tests for it."
