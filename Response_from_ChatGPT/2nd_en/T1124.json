Simple and straightforward implementation using the built-in datetime package in Python.\n2. Returns the current system time accurately.\n3. No external dependencies or additional packages required.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: time\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\nAdvantages:\n1. Uses the time package in Python to format the current system time.\n2. Provides flexibility in formatting the time according to the desired format.\n3. No external dependencies or additional packages required.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Cannot display the time accurately beyond the second precision.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: ctypes, datetime\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\nAdvantages:\n1. Uses the ctypes package to access the underlying system APIs, providing a low-level interface for system time retrieval.\n2. Returns the current system time accurately, including microsecond precision.\n\nDisadvantage:\n1. Requires the use of ctypes package, which may not be available in all Python environments.\n\nSince Solution 1 has the highest score of 10, we will proceed to write functional test and unit test code for Solution 1.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1124-System Time Discovery\n\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\nimport datetime\n\ndef test_system_time_discovery():\n    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n    system_time_discovery()\n    # Compare the printed current system time with the actual system time\n    assert captured_output.getvalue().strip() == \"Current system time: {}\".format(current_time)\n\ntest_system_time_discovery()"
