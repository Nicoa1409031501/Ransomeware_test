Advantages:\n   - Uses the official docker package for Python, which has strong community support and is regularly updated.\n   - Provides a high-level API for interacting with the Docker API, making it easy to build container images on the host.\n   - Handles authentication and connection handling with the Docker daemon.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires Docker to be installed and running on the host machine.\n   - Relies on external tooling (Docker) and may not be suitable for environments where Docker is not available.\n   - Limited control over the build process compared to running the build command directly with subprocess.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses the subprocess module, which is part of the standard library and does not require any additional installation.\n   - Provides more control over the build process compared to the high-level API of the docker package.\n   - Can be used in environments where Docker is not available.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires constructing the build command manually, which can be error-prone if not done correctly.\n   - Does not handle authentication and connection handling with the Docker daemon.\n   - Limited error handling and logging compared to the docker package.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 2\nUsed packages: dockerapi (custom package)\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Hypothetical package designed specifically for interacting with the Docker API in a more customizable way.\n   - Provides additional features and configuration options not available in the other solutions.\n   - Allows for a more tailored integration with the existing infrastructure.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - The dockerapi package does not actually exist and is mentioned for demonstration purposes only.\n   - Requires the development or integration of a custom library to provide the desired functionality.\n   - Relies on the availability and maintenance of the custom dockerapi package.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution 1 scores the highest with a score of 9. This solution uses the official docker package, provides an easy-to-use API for building container images, and has strong community support."
