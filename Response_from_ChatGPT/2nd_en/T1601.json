Method 1:\n   - Advantages: Directly modifies the system image file, ensuring changes are persistent even after reboot.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Requires direct access to the system image file on disk, which might not be feasible depending on the system architecture and security restrictions.\n     - If not done carefully, it can potentially corrupt the system image and render the network device inoperable.\n\n2. Method 2:\n   - Advantages: Modifies the system image in memory during runtime, avoiding the need for disk access and filesystem modifications.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Changes made in memory may not persist after reboot unless specifically implemented to save the changes.\n     - Requires a good understanding of the system image structure and file format.\n\n3. Method 3:\n   - Advantages: Provides a rollback mechanism by installing an older version of the operating system.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Requires access to the older version of the operating system image.\n     - Depending on the network device, downgrading the operating system might not be supported or may lead to compatibility issues.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1606- Get Help Content\n\n1. Method 1: Reading help content from local documentation files\n   - Packages used: os\n   - Functionalities used: File operations (`open()`, `read()`, `close()`)\n   - Steps:\n        1. Locate the directory containing the help documentation files\n        2. Identify the specific file containing the help content based on the requested topic\n        3. Open the file and read its content\n        4. Close the file and return the help content\n\n2. Method 2: Fetching help content from a remote server/website\n   - Packages used: requests\n   - Functionalities used: HTTP requests (`get()`)\n   - Steps:\n        1. Build the URL for the specific help topic based on the requested topic\n        2. Send an HTTP GET request to the server/website\n        3. Retrieve the response content\n        4. Process the response content and extract the help content\n        5. Return the help content\n\n3. Method 3: Accessing a help API\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionalities used: API calls\n   - Steps:\n        1. Identify the endpoint and parameters required to access the help content\n        2. Make an API call to the help API with the appropriate parameters\n        3. Retrieve the help content from the API response\n        4. Return the help content\n\nNote: Method 1 assumes the existence of local documentation files, while Method 2 and Method 3 involve retrieving help content from external sources. The specific implementation will depend on the availability of local documentation or access to remote help resources."
