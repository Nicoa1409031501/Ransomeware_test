Disadvantage: May not work on all operating systems or in restricted environments.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantage: Provides more control and flexibility over executing commands.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires importing the subprocess package.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: pywin32\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantage: Works specifically for Windows platforms.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires installing an additional package.\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 2 received the highest score and is considered the most feasible solution.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1113-Screen Capture\n\nTo implement the functionality of T1113 - Screen Capture, we can use Python and the following methods:\n\nMethod 1:\n- Packages used: pyautogui\n- Functionalities used: pyautogui.screenshot()\n- Steps:\n  1. Import the pyautogui package by using the line 'import pyautogui'.\n  2. Write a function that captures the screen using the pyautogui.screenshot() function and saves it as an image file.\n  3. Save the function in a Python script.\n\nMethod 2:\n- Packages used: PIL (Python Imaging Library)\n- Functionalities used: ImageGrab.grab()\n- Steps:\n  1. Import the PIL package by using the line 'from PIL import ImageGrab'.\n  2. Write a function that captures the screen using the ImageGrab.grab() function from PIL and saves it as an image file.\n  3. Save the function in a Python script.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to see the sample code for any of the above methods."
