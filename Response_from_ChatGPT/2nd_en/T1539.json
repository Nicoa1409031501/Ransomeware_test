Evaluation:\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie]\n\n[Solution 1]\nPackages Used: requests, BeautifulSoup, sys, os\nAdvantages:\n- Simple and straightforward implementation\n- Uses popular libraries requests and BeautifulSoup for HTTP requests and HTML parsing\n- Can save the stolen session cookie to a file for further analysis\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires knowledge of the session cookie name\n- Relies on the structure of the HTML response to extract the session cookie\n- Limited to static web pages\n[Score]: 8\n\n[Solution 2]\nPackages Used: selenium, webdriver_manager\nAdvantages:\n- Can handle dynamic web content and JavaScript-based actions\n- Provides options to run Chrome in headless mode (without opening a browser window)\n- Can save the stolen cookie to a file for further analysis\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires the installation of the Chrome WebDriver and its dependencies\n- May be slower compared to other methods due to the use of an actual browser\n- Requires knowledge of the session cookie name\n[Score]: 9\n\n[Solution 3]\nPackages Used: mitmproxy\nAdvantages:\n- Can capture session cookies from any network traffic (not limited to HTTP requests/responses)\n- Provides more flexibility in capturing the session cookie from different web applications or services\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires setting up a proxy and configuring the target to use the proxy\n- Requires knowledge of the session cookie name\n[Score]: 7\n\n2. Scoring:\n\nSolution 1: 8 - 0 = 8\nSolution 2: 9 - 0 = 9\nSolution 3: 7 - 0 = 7\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 2 has the highest score and is the most promising solution.\n\n3.
