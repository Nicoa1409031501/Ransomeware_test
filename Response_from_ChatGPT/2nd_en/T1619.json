Solution One: This solution cannot be implemented without access to the cloud storage environment or proper credentials. It requires access to the cloud storage service, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.\n\n2. Solution Two: Similarly, this solution cannot be implemented without access to the cloud storage environment or proper credentials. It also requires access to the cloud storage service, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.\n\n3.
