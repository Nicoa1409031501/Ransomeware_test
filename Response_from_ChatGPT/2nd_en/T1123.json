[Solution 1]\n   - Score: 8\n   - Used packages: pyaudio, wave\n   - Advantages: \n       - Uses widely supported packages for audio capturing and processing.\n       - Provides flexibility in adjusting audio settings.\n   - Disadvantages: \n       - Requires installation of external packages.\n       - Limited platform support (may not work on some operating systems).\n   \n2. [Solution 2]\n   - Score: 9\n   - Used packages: sounddevice, soundfile\n   - Advantages: \n       - Uses well-documented and actively maintained packages.\n       - Supports a wide range of platforms and audio devices.\n       - Simplifies the code with higher-level abstractions.\n   - Disadvantages: \n       - Requires installation of external packages.\n   \n3. [Solution 3]\n   - Score: 7\n   - Used packages: subprocess\n   - Advantages: \n       - Does not require installation of external audio packages.\n       - Can work on macOS and Linux systems without additional setup.\n   - Disadvantages: \n       - Limited to macOS and Linux systems.\n       - Relies on external command-line tool `arecord`.\n       - Requires the availability of the `arecord` tool on the system.\n   \nNOTE: Based on the scores, Solution 2 is the highest scoring solution and warrants further testing.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1123-Audio Capture\n[Solution 2 Unit Test]\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport sounddevice as sd\nimport soundfile as sf\n\ndef test_audio_capture():\n    output_file = \"audio.wav\"\n    duration = 5  # 5 seconds\n\n    fs = 44100  # Sample rate\n    expected_samples = int(duration * fs)\n\n    myrecording = sd.rec(expected_samples, samplerate=fs, channels=1)\n    sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished\n\n    # Check if the recorded audio has the expected number of samples\n    assert len(myrecording) == expected_samples\n\n    # Check if the output file was created\n    assert os.path.exists(output_file)\n\n    # Load the recorded audio from the output file\n    audio, loaded_fs = sf.read(output_file)\n\n    # Check if the loaded audio has the expected sample rate\n    assert loaded_fs == fs\n\n    # Check if the loaded audio has the expected number of samples\n    assert len(audio) == expected_samples\n\n    # Clean up the temporary audio file\n    os.remove(output_file)\n\n    print(\"Unit test passed!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_audio_capture()\n```\n\nFile: test_audio_capture.py\n\nNote: This unit test validates the functionality of Solution 2 by capturing audio for a specified duration, checking if the recorded audio has the expected number of samples, if the output file exists, if the loaded audio has the expected sample rate and number of samples, and finally, cleaning up the temporary audio file."
