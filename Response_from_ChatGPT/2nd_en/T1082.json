The code is concise and uses the `platform` module, which provides a high-level and cross-platform way to retrieve system information.\n2. No errors or disadvantages found.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8.5\nUsed packages: os\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code is simple and uses the `os` module, which is a built-in module in Python.\n2. No errors or disadvantages found.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7.5\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code uses the `subprocess` module to execute commands and capture their output, allowing retrieval of system information.\n2. One disadvantage is that it relies on the availability and consistency of the `wmic` command on the host machine.\n\nAmong the three solutions, Solution 1 has the highest score of 9.5 due to its simplicity, use of a dedicated module, and absence of any disadvantages. Solution 2 has a score of 8.5 and Solution 3 has a score of 7.5 due to their reliance on accessing system information through command execution."
