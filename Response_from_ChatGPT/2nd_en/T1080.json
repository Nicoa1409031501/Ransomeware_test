Advantage: The solution uses the shutil library, which provides a high-level interface for file operations, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n2. Disadvantage: The solution requires copying the original file, which may not be feasible in certain scenarios where the file size is large.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: mmap\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The solution directly modifies the file using memory mapping, which can be faster for large files.\n2. Disadvantage: The solution requires more low-level operations with memory mapping, making the code slightly more complex.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: os\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: The solution creates a symbolic link to the original file, allowing for easy modification without duplicating the file.\n2. Disadvantage: The solution may not be supported on all operating systems, as symbolic link creation is OS-dependent.\n\nSince Solution 1 has the highest score, we will write functional and unit tests for Solution 1.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1080-Taint Shared Content\n\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\n\n# This code assumes that the taint_shared_content function from Solution 1 is available\ndef test_taint_shared_content():\n    # Define the original file path and malicious content\n    file_path = \"shared_file.txt\"\n    malicious_content = \"This content is tainted!\"\n\n    # Create a copy of the original file\n    shutil.copyfile(file_path, \"tainted_file.txt\")\n    \n    # Call the taint_shared_content function\n    taint_shared_content(\"tainted_file.txt\", malicious_content)\n\n    # Check if the content was successfully tainted\n    with open(\"tainted_file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n        content = f.read()\n        if malicious_content in content:\n            print(\"Content successfully tainted.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Content tainting failed.\")\n\n# Run the test\ntest_taint_shared_content()"
