        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: requests, subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The solution makes use of well-established packages like requests and subprocess, ensuring reliable functionality.\n2. The code is concise and easy to understand.\n3. The solution can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted payload to the target URL.\n4. The use of subprocess.call() allows for the execution of external commands, providing flexibility in the exploitation process.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: selenium, webdriver\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The solution makes use of the selenium package, which is widely used for web automation and testing.\n2. The code launches a Chrome WebDriver and opens the target URL, simulating a client's interaction.\n3. The solution can exploit the vulnerability by navigating to the target URL with a crafted payload.\n4. The use of webdriver.Chrome() may require additional setup and configuration, which can be complicated for certain environments.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: metasploit\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The solution uses the metasploit package, which is a powerful tool for penetration testing and exploit development.\n2. The code establishes a connection with Metasploit and executes the specified exploit module.\n3. The solution can exploit the vulnerability by executing the provided payload against the target URL.\n4. The use of metasploit may require advanced knowledge and setup, making it less accessible for beginners.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution 1 received the highest score of 9. Therefore, we will proceed to write functional and unit test code for Solution 1."
