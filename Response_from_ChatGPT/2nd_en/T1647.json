Advantages:\n   - Uses a built-in module for working with plist files in a simple and straightforward manner.\n   - Supports both reading and writing of plist files.\n   - No additional dependencies are required.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Limited to working with XML-based plist files only.\n   - May not handle complex or nested structures in plist files as expected.\n   - Performance may be slower for large plist files.\n\n[Solution Two]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: biplist\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Supports working with both XML-based and binary plist files.\n   - Provides a pure Python implementation without any external dependencies.\n   - Supports reading and writing of plist files.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - May have limitations or compatibility issues with certain types of binary plist files.\n   - Lack of extensive documentation and community support compared to other solutions.\n   - Performance may be slower for large or complex plist files.\n\n[Solution Three]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: xml.etree.ElementTree\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Built-in Python module for handling XML-based plist files.\n   - Supports reading and writing of XML-based plist files.\n   - Provides a flexible and customizable approach for modifying plist files.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires additional handling for binary plist files.\n   - May be more complex to use compared to dedicated plist parsing libraries.\n   - Performance may be slower for large or complex plist files.\n\nBased on the evaluation criteria, Solution One (using plistlib) has the highest score of 8. \n\nNext, let's proceed with functional test and unit test code for Solution One."
