Advantages: \n   - The solution uses the popular requests library to make HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, making it easy to implement.\n   - It can handle static webpages well and extract information based on CSS selectors.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - This solution may not work well with dynamic webpages where content is loaded dynamically through JavaScript.\n\n[Solution 2]\nScore: 8\nUsed packages: Selenium, BeautifulSoup\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - The solution uses Selenium in combination with BeautifulSoup, making it capable of handling dynamic webpages.\n   - It can extract information based on CSS selectors, similar to Solution 1.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - The overhead of using Selenium and the need to control a web browser may be seen as a disadvantage in terms of performance.\n   - It requires installing a compatible web driver (e.g., Firefox driver, Chrome driver) for Selenium.\n\n[Solution 3]\nScore: 8\nUsed packages: whois\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - This solution uses the whois package, which is specifically designed for looking up domain information.\n   - It provides a convenient way to gather organization information by performing a whois lookup on a given domain.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - It may not provide as much detailed information as scraping a website.\n   - It relies on the availability and accuracy of the domain's whois information.\n\nOverall, all three solutions are feasible and provide different approaches to gather organization information. Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more suitable for scraping webpages, while Solution 3 focuses on domain information lookup. The scores for all solutions are relatively high, indicating that they are all valid options depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the environment."
