[Solution 1]\n\nUsed packages: requests\n\nAdvantages:\n- Easy-to-use and widely adopted library for making HTTP requests\n- Provides high-level abstractions for working with HTTP (e.g., handling request and response bodies, headers, etc.)\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires the installation of the requests package if not already available\n- Relies on an external library, which may introduce additional dependency management considerations\n\n[Score]: 8\n\n2.

[Solution 3]\n\nUsed packages: urllib.request, urllib.parse, json\n\nAdvantages:\n- Built-in packages, so no additional installation is required\n- Provides control over HTTP connections and requests\n- Supports Python 3.x without relying on external libraries\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires manual encoding and decoding of request and response bodies\n- More verbose and lower-level compared to higher-level libraries like requests\n\n[Score]: 7"
