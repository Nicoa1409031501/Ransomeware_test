Provides control over the amount of data (in this case null bytes) written to the disk.\n3. Portable solution that can be used on different operating systems.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. May not work accurately if the disk is mounted and actively used by the operating system while attempting to wipe it.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages:\n1. Utilizes a well-known and widely used command-line tool (`dd`) for disk wiping.\n2. Works well for wiping disks on Linux-based systems.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Relies on the `dd` command being available and accessible on the system.\n2. May have limited compatibility with non-Linux systems.\n3. Requires a well-defined disk path and may not handle different disk formats or partitions.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: shutil\nAdvantages:\n1. Uses the `disk_usage` function from the `shutil` module, providing a higher-level interface for disk manipulation.\n2. Can be useful for other disk-related operations, such as obtaining disk usage information.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Limited flexibility and control over the actual wiping process.\n2. May not offer complete disk wiping, depending on the implementation of the `disk_usage` function.\n\nSince the highest score is 10 and the lowest is 0, the scoring for each solution is as follows:\n- Solution 1: 9\n- Solution 2: 8\n- Solution 3: 7"
