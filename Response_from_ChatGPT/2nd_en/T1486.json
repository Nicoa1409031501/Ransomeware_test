Advantages:\n   - The code uses the popular cryptography package, which provides secure encryption algorithms.\n   - The code encrypts files using Fernet encryption, providing strong symmetric encryption.\n   - The code scans and encrypts files in a given directory and its subdirectories.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - The code does not handle exceptions or error scenarios.\n   - The encryption key is hard-coded in the code, which could be a security risk.\n   - The code overwrites the original files with encrypted versions, without any backup or recovery mechanism.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: shutil, random\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - The code uses the shutil package to perform disk operations, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.\n   - The code wipes the content of a disk drive using random data, making it difficult to recover any previously stored data.\n   - The code allows for wiping individual files or whole disk drives.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - The code does not check for read or write permissions when wiping disk drives.\n   - The code does not handle exceptions or error scenarios.\n   - The code does not provide any confirmation prompts before wiping the disk, which could lead to accidental data loss.\n\n[Solution 3]\n(Solution is not feasible, please try another solution)"
