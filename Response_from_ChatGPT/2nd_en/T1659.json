The code uses the requests package, which is a widely-used package for sending HTTP requests in Python.\n2. The solution includes error handling for exceptions that may occur during the execution.\n3. The code correctly injects the payload into the content and posts the modified content back to the URL.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: urllib.request, urllib.parse\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code uses built-in Python modules urllib.request and urllib.parse for sending HTTP requests and encoding parameters.\n2. The solution includes error handling for exceptions that may occur during the execution.\n3. The code correctly injects the payload into the content and posts the modified content back to the URL.\n4. However, the code may be less intuitive and require more manual encoding compared to Solution 1.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: BeautifulSoup, requests\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code uses BeautifulSoup, a popular HTML parsing library, and requests package for sending HTTP requests.\n2. The solution includes error handling for exceptions that may occur during the execution.\n3. The code correctly finds the body tag in the HTML content and injects the payload.\n4. However, the code requires converting the BeautifulSoup object to a string before posting the modified content back to the URL.\n\nSince Solution 1 has the highest score of 9, we will proceed with writing functional test and unit test code for Solution 1.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or instructions."
