Advantages:\n   - Uses low-level sockets for direct TCP/IP communication with the C2 server.\n   - Allows for bidirectional communication, with the ability to send commands and receive responses.\n   - Can handle large volumes of data.\n   \n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires knowledge of networking concepts and socket programming.\n   - Does not provide built-in encryption or authentication. Additional measures would need to be taken to secure the communication channel.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: requests\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses HTTP requests, which are commonly allowed through firewalls.\n   - Simple and intuitive implementation using the requests library.\n   - Supports both submitting commands and receiving responses using the query parameters of the URL.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires the C2 server to be accessible via HTTPS or HTTP.\n   - May be subject to network security policies that limit or block outgoing HTTP requests.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: smtplib\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses the widely supported email protocol, allowing for fallback communication through email servers.\n   - Can work even if direct network communication is restricted or blocked.\n   \n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Relies on external email servers for message delivery, which may introduce delay and dependency on third-party services.\n   - Requires sending commands via email and receiving responses through another channel, such as inbox monitoring or an automated email parser.\n   - Email-based communication may require additional security measures to protect the data in transit.\n\nSince Solution 2 scored higher than 8, we will proceed with writing functional tests and unit tests for Solution 2. It will be renamed as [Solution 2 Unit Test]."
