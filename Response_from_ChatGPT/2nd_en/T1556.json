Advantages: Uses a widely-used package for executing shell commands, can easily capture output/error codes from the executed command.\n2. Disadvantages: May not be suitable for all platforms, as it relies on shell commands.\n\n[Solution Two]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: pexpect\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantages: Provides a higher-level interface for controlling and interacting with processes, supports automating interactive command execution.\n2. Disadvantages: Requires installation of the pexpect package, may require additional code complexity to handle different authentication process scenarios.\n\n[Solution Three]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: pywin32\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantages: Windows-specific package, provides access to various Windows APIs and functionalities, can be used for manipulating the authentication process on Windows systems.\n2. Disadvantages: Limited to Windows systems, may require additional code complexity to handle different authentication process scenarios.\n\nSince Solution Two scored the highest with a score of 9, we will proceed to write functional and unit tests for that solution.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1556-Modify Authentication Process]\n[Solution Two Unit Test]\n\n```python\nimport pexpect\n\ndef test_modify_authentication_process():\n    # Write functional test here\n\n    return\n```\n\nPlease note that the functional test for Solution Two would depend on the specific scenario and steps required to modify the authentication process. Further research and analysis are needed to develop an accurate functional test."
