        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: boto3, paramiko\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution utilizes the AWS Systems Manager to remotely execute commands on EC2 instances, providing a secure and controlled method of cloud administration.\n2. Advantage: The paramiko library allows for SSH connections, providing flexibility in managing different types of virtual machines.\n3. Disadvantage: The use of AWS Systems Manager requires proper AWS credentials and permissions.\n4. Disadvantage: Paramiko may have a steep learning curve for those who are not familiar with SSH connections.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: azure-identity, azure-mgmt-resource, azure-mgmt-compute\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution utilizes Azure RunCommand, which provides a built-in mechanism for running commands on Azure virtual machines.\n2. Advantage: The azure-identity library makes authentication and credential management easier.\n3. Disadvantage: Azure RunCommand may have limitations or restrictions depending on the specific Azure subscription or virtual machine configuration.\n4. Disadvantage: To use this solution, you need appropriate Azure credentials and permissions.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: msgraph-sdk-python, oauthlib, requests_oauthlib\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the Microsoft Graph API to run scripts on devices managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager, allowing for cloud administration of on-premises devices.\n2. Disadvantage: The msgraph-sdk-python library may have a learning curve for those unfamiliar with Microsoft Graph API.\n3. Disadvantage: The use of Microsoft Graph API requires proper credentials and permissions.\n4. Disadvantage: This solution is limited to devices managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager and may not be suitable for all environments.\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 1 (AWS Systems Manager with paramiko) received the highest score and seems to be the most feasible option for cloud administration command functionality in this environment.\n\nNext, I will proceed to write the functional test and unit test code for Solution 1."
