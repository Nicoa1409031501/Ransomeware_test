The implementation is straightforward and simple.\n2. It uses built-in Python modules, so no additional packages need to be installed.\nDisadvantages: None\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: subprocess\nInput files: None\nOutput files: None\nCorrectness of syntax and logic: The code has correct syntax and logic.\nAdvantages:\n1. The implementation is cross-platform, as it works on both Windows and Linux operating systems.\n2. It uses the subprocess module, which provides more control and flexibility compared to os.system().\nDisadvantages:\n1. It requires the subprocess module, which may not be available in some Python distributions by default.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 10\nUsed packages: platform, subprocess\nInput files: None\nOutput files: None\nCorrectness of syntax and logic: The code has correct syntax and logic.\nAdvantages:\n1. The implementation detects the operating system and executes the appropriate command automatically.\n2. It supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.\nDisadvantages: None\n\nBased on the evaluation, the scores are as follows:\nSolution 1: 9\nSolution 2: 8\nSolution 3: 10\n\nSince Solution 3 has the highest score, we will proceed with writing functional and unit tests for it."
