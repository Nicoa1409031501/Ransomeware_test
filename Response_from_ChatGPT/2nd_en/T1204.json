Process discovery involves monitoring and analyzing system processes, which requires access to the underlying operating system. As an AI language model, I do not have direct access to the operating system's processes or the ability to monitor them.\n\nIt is recommended to implement this technique using a programming language that has access to system-level APIs or utilities provided by the operating system itself."
