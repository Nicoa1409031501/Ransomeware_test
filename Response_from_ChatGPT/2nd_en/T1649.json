        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: cryptography\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The cryptography package provides high-level abstractions and easy-to-use functions for working with certificates and keys.\n2. The code is well-structured and modular, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n3. The functions provide error handling and support for password-protected private keys.\n4. The cryptography package is actively maintained and has a large user base.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: jwt\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The PyJWT package provides a simple and convenient way to generate and verify JWT tokens.\n2. The code is concise and easy to understand.\n3. The package supports various algorithms for signing and verifying tokens.\n4. The PyJWT package has good documentation and a large user community.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 5\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Using the OpenSSL command-line tool allows for more flexibility and customization.\n2. The commands can be executed outside of the Python script, which may offer more control in certain scenarios.\n3. The code becomes more complex as it involves executing external commands and parsing their outputs.\n4. The OpenSSL tool requires prior installation and may not be available on all systems by default.\n\nBased on the scores, [Solution 1] using the cryptography package is the most recommended solution, as it scores the highest and offers a good balance of usability and security."
