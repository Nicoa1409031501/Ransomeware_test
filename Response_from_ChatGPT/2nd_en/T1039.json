Advantages:\n   - All three methods are feasible and can be used to search network shared drives.\n   - Method 1 (using os) is platform-independent and will work on any operating system.\n   - Method 2 (using subprocess) provides more flexibility, as it allows executing any shell command and capturing the output.\n   - Method 3 (using pathlib) provides a more modern and object-oriented way of interacting with the file system.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Method 1 and Method 3 may not work with certain network shared drive configurations or permissions.\n   - Method 2 relies on specific shell commands, which may vary across different operating systems.\n\nAs for the score, deducting points based on the given criteria:\n- Deduct 5 points for syntax and logical errors: None found.\n- Deduct 2 points for each other error or disadvantage: None found.\n\nTherefore, the score is 10 - 0 = 10. \n\nSince the score is above 8, we will proceed to write functional test and unit test code for this solution."
