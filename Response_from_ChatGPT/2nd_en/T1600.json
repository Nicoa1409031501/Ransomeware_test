Method 1 (Using Python Crypto Package)\n   - Advantages:\n     - Utilizes a well-known and widely-used cryptographic package.\n     - Provides a straightforward and convenient way to generate weak encryption keys and perform encryption/decryption operations.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Requires the installation of the cryptography package.\n     - Weak encryption algorithms may be deprecated or removed in future versions of the package.\n   - Score: 8\n\n2. Method 2 (Implementing a Custom Weak Encryption Algorithm)\n   - Advantages:\n     - Provides full control over the encryption algorithm and its weaknesses.\n     - Does not depend on external packages.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Custom algorithms may have their own implementation flaws.\n     - Custom algorithms are not widely tested or recognized, making them more prone to attacks.\n   - Score: 6\n\n3. Method 3 (Modifying Existing Encryption Libraries)\n   - Advantages:\n     - Uses existing encryption libraries, reducing the complexity of implementation.\n     - Provides some degree of customization without starting from scratch.\n   - Disadvantages:\n     - Modifying existing encryption libraries requires deep understanding of their internals and the potential risks associated with weakened encryption.\n     - Modifying encryption libraries may introduce unintended vulnerabilities.\n   - Score: 7\n\nTest code for solution 1 can be written as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n\ndef weak_encryption_test():\n    # Generate a weak encryption key\n    key = b'weak_key'\n\n    # Create a cipher object with the weak key\n    cipher = Fernet(key)\n\n    # Encrypt and decrypt the data\n    plaintext = b'Sensitive data'\n    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)\n    decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"Plaintext:\", plaintext)\n    print(\"Encrypted Text:\", ciphertext)\n    print(\"Decrypted Text:\", decrypted_text)\n\n\n# Call the test function\nweak_encryption_test()\n```\n\nNote: This test code demonstrates the usage of the cryptography package for weak encryption. It generates a weak encryption key and uses it to encrypt and decrypt data. The results are printed to the console.\n\nPlease note that testing weak encryption should only be done in controlled environments and never in production systems."
