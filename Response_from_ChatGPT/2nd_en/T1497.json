The advantage of this method is that it performs system checks based on system memory and information, which can help identify if the system is a virtual machine or not.\n2. The disadvantage is that it may not be foolproof as virtual machines can have similar system memory and information as physical machines.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: win32gui (Windows), AppKit (macOS), Xlib (Linux)\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The advantage of this method is that it checks for user activity by getting the active window/application, which can provide insights into whether the environment is a virtual machine or not.\n2. The disadvantage is that it may not be applicable for all operating systems, as different packages are used for different platforms.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: time\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The advantage of this method is that it leverages time-based checks, which can help identify if the system is running in a virtual environment.\n2. The disadvantage is that it may not be completely accurate, as the system's time can be manipulated in virtual machines.\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 1 has the highest score of 9 and is considered the most feasible solution for further testing.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\n1.

Write unit test code:\n\ndef test_is_virtual_machine():\n    # Test case 1: Virtual machine with less than or equal to 2GB memory\n    assert is_virtual_machine() == True, \"Test case 1 failed\"\n\n    # Test case 2: Physical machine with more than 2GB memory\n    assert is_virtual_machine() == False, \"Test case 2 failed\"\n\n    # Test case 3: Virtual machine with Linux x86_64 system info\n    assert is_virtual_machine() == True, \"Test case 3 failed\"\n\n    # Test case 4: Physical machine with non-Linux or non-x86_64 system info\n    assert is_virtual_machine() == False, \"Test case 4 failed\"\n\n    print(\"All unit tests passed\")\n\n3.
