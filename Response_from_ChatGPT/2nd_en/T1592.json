Advantage: Uses the psutil package which provides a high-level interface for retrieving system information.\n2. Advantage: Retrieves virtual memory, disk, temperature, and platform information.\n3. Disadvantage: May have limited cross-platform compatibility.\n4. Disadvantage: May not retrieve all available system information.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: wmi, platform\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Uses the wmi package which provides a Windows-specific interface for retrieving system information.\n2. Advantage: Retrieves computer system, operating system, and platform information.\n3. Disadvantage: Limited to Windows systems.\n4. Disadvantage: May not retrieve all available system information.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\n\nUsed packages: subprocess, platform\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Uses subprocess to execute WMIC commands and retrieve system information.\n2. Advantage: Retrieves host hardware and software information.\n3. Disadvantage: Limited to Windows systems.\n4. Disadvantage: Relies on the availability and execution of WMIC commands.\n\n[Solution 1] Unit Test:\n```python\ndef test_gather_host_information():\n    host_info = gather_host_information()\n    assert isinstance(host_info, dict)\n    assert \"Total memory\" in host_info\n    assert \"System\" in host_info\n    assert \"Node name\" in host_info\n\ntest_gather_host_information()\n```\n\n[Solution 2 Unit Test]:\n```python\ndef test_gather_host_information():\n    host_info = gather_host_information()\n    assert isinstance(host_info, dict)\n    assert \"Name\" in host_info\n    assert \"Operating system\" in host_info\n    assert \"Machine\" in host_info\n\ntest_gather_host_information()\n```\n\n[Solution 3]"
