The use of subprocess allows for running command line commands and capturing their output.\n2. Easy to implement and understand.\n3. The code is concise and straightforward.\n4. However, the subprocess.run() method waits for the command to complete, which may cause delays if the commands take a long time to execute.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: os\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The use of os allows for running command line commands and capturing their output.\n2. Easy to implement and understand.\n3. Can be used in a variety of scenarios where the subprocess package is not available.\n4. The os.system() method executes the command without waiting for it to complete, which can be beneficial in certain cases.\n5. However, os.system() does not capture the output of the command, so further processing may be required.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: scapy\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The use of scapy allows for constructing and sending custom network packets.\n2. Provides more control and flexibility in network discovery.\n3. Can be used for more advanced network scanning and analysis.\n4. Requires a deeper understanding of network protocols and packet manipulation.\n5. May require additional configuration and privileges to work properly.\n6. The sending of network packets may raise security concerns in certain environments.\n\nSince Solution 2 has the highest score, let's proceed to write functional and unit tests for it.\n\n[Solution 2 Unit Test]\nFunctional Test:\n\n```python\ndef test_remote_system_discovery():\n    remote_system_discovery()\n```\n\nUnit Test:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestRemoteSystemDiscovery(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_remote_system_discovery(self):\n        remote_system_discovery()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nNote: The functional test simply calls the remote_system_discovery() function, whereas the unit test uses the unittest module to perform more comprehensive tests, including assertions and assertions."
