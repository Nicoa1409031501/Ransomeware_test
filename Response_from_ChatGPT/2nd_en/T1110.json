Method 1:\nPackages used: subprocess\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef discover_device_drivers():\n    result = subprocess.run([\"cmd\", \"/c\", \"driverquery\"], capture_output=True, text=True)\n    driver_output = result.stdout.strip()\n    \n    # Process driver output as needed\n    # ...\n    \n    print(driver_output)\n\ndiscover_device_drivers()\n```\n\n2. Method 2:\nPackages used: os\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef discover_device_drivers():\n    result = os.popen(\"driverquery\").read()\n    driver_output = result.strip()\n    \n    # Process driver output as needed\n    # ...\n    \n    print(driver_output)\n\ndiscover_device_drivers()\n```\n\n3. Method 3:\nPackages used: wmic\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef discover_device_drivers():\n    commands = [\"wmic\", \"PATH\", \"Win32_PnPSignedDriver\", \"WHERE\", \"DeviceName\", \"IS\", \"NOT\", \"NULL\", \"GET\", \"Description\"]\n    result = subprocess.run(commands, capture_output=True, text=True)\n    driver_output = result.stdout.strip()\n    \n    # Process driver output as needed\n    # ...\n    \n    print(driver_output)\n\ndiscover_device_drivers()\n```\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\nMethod 1:\n- Advantages:\n  - Uses a subprocess to run a command, making it easy to interact with the system and capture output.\n- Disadvantages:\n  - May have limited compatibility across operating systems.\n  \nMethod 2:\n- Advantages:\n  - Uses the os module which is available in standard Python installations.\n- Disadvantages:\n  - May have limited functionality compared to a dedicated tool like driverquery.\n  \nMethod 3:\n- Advantages:\n  - Uses the wmic command to specifically query device drivers, providing more accurate results.\n- Disadvantages:\n  - Requires the subprocess module to interact with the command line.\n  \nScore:\nMethod 1: 7/10\nMethod 2: 6/10\nMethod 3: 8/10"
