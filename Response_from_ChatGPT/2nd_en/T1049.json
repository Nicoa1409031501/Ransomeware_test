However, this specific functionality cannot be implemented through programming alone. Device driver information is specific to the underlying operating system and hardware architecture, and therefore it requires low-level access to the system.\n\nTo gather device driver information, one option would be to use system-specific command-line tools, such as `devcon` on Windows or `lshw` on Linux. These tools provide command-line interfaces to retrieve device driver information. However, this task cannot be directly accomplished with Python alone.\n\nTo implement this TTP, you would need to execute system commands and parse the output to extract the desired information. Therefore, the implementation would depend on the specific operating system and command-line tools available.\n\nAs a result, the Device Driver Discovery TTP cannot be implemented solely using Python code in the current environment."
