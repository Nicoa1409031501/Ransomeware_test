Uses the subprocess module to execute the `gpresult` command, providing a convenient and reliable way to retrieve Group Policy information.\n2. The code is concise and straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. The code relies on the availability and proper configuration of the `gpresult` command on the system.\n\n[Solution 2]\nScore: 8\n\nUsed packages: os\nAdvantages:\n1. Uses the os module to execute the `gpresult` command and capture the output, providing flexibility in handling the command execution.\n2. The code is platform-independent, as it utilizes the os module.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Similar to Solution 1, it relies on the availability and proper configuration of the `gpresult` command.\n\n[Solution 3]\nScore: 7\n\nUsed packages: python-wmi\nAdvantages:\n1. Utilizes the python-wmi package to query the WMI for Group Policy information, offering more flexibility in accessing and manipulating the data.\n2. Provides access to a wider range of Group Policy data compared to the gpresult command.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Requires the installation of the python-wmi package, which introduces an additional dependency.\n2. May have a steeper learning curve for those not familiar with the python-wmi package.\n\nFor T1615-Group Policy Discovery, Solution 1 achieves the highest score with a score of 9. We will proceed to write the functional test and unit test code for Solution 1."
