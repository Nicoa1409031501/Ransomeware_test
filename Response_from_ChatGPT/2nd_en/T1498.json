Capture the output of the command.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef execute_command(command):\n    result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)\n    return result.stdout\n```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: os\nFunctionality:\n1. Execute a single command using the os.system function.\n2. Capture the output of the command.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef execute_command(command):\n    result = os.system(command)\n    return result\n```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: subprocess\nFunctionality:\n1. Execute a single command using the subprocess.Popen function.\n2. Capture the output of the command.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef execute_command(command):\n    result = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)\n    output, _ = result.communicate()\n    return output\n```\n\nScore Evaluation:\n[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The advantage is that it allows capturing the output as a return value.\n2. The disadvantage is that it may be limited in executing complex commands.\n3. The score is 8 (syntax and logic are correct, one minor disadvantage).\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: os\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The advantage is that it is a simple and straightforward method.\n2. The disadvantage is that it does not allow capturing the output as a return value.\n3. The score is 7 (syntax and logic are correct, one significant disadvantage).\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The advantage is that it allows capturing the output as a return value.\n2. The disadvantage is that it may have performance overhead for long-running commands.\n3. The score is 9 (syntax and logic are correct, one minor disadvantage).\n\nBased on the score evaluation, Solution 3 with a score of 9 seems to be the best choice.\n\nNext, let's proceed with the functional test and unit test code for Solution 3."
