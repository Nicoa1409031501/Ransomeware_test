Advantages:\n   - Uses a widely-used HTTP library (requests) to make API requests.\n   - Handles potential network and API errors gracefully.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires an external API to retrieve system language information.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: geocoder\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses a dedicated package (geocoder) for IP address geolocation.\n   - Simplicity of implementation.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Relies on a third-party API for location information.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: ipinfo\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses a dedicated package (ipinfo) for IP address geolocation.\n   - Provides detailed information about the IP address.\n   - Can handle API quota limits.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires signing up for an API access token from ipinfo.io.\n\nSince Solution 1 and Solution 3 have scores over 8, we should proceed with writing functional and unit test code for those solutions."
