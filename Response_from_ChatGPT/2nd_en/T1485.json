        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: os, shutil\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - The Shutil method ensures that file content is overwritten with zeros, making data recovery difficult.\n   - It works on all operating systems that support the Python shutil module.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Cannot handle files that are locked or inaccessible due to permission restrictions.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: subprocess\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Utilizes a command-line tool (sdel) specifically designed for secure file deletion.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires installation of the Secure Delete (sdel) tool and its availability in the system's PATH.\n   - Platform-specific tool (Windows). Does not work on other operating systems.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: pynput\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Simulates keyboard input to select and delete files, which can be useful in certain scenarios.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Relies on the pynput package, which may introduce dependencies and compatibility issues.\n   - Limited to operating systems that support keyboard shortcuts for file deletion.\n   - May not work with file managers that do not support keyboard shortcuts for file deletion.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution 1 (using the Shutil module) has the highest score of 9. We will proceed to write functional test and unit test code for Solution 1."
