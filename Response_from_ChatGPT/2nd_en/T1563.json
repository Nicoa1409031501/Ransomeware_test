        "content":"[Solution 1]\n[Score]: 7\n\nPackages used: paramiko\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code uses a well-established SSH library (paramiko) to establish a remote SSH session.\n2. The code is straightforward and easy to understand.\n3. However, the implementation does not handle potential error scenarios, such as invalid credentials or SSH server unavailability.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\n\nPackages used: pywinrm\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code utilizes the pywinrm library to establish a remote PowerShell session over WinRM.\n2. It provides a secure and efficient way to interact with remote Windows systems.\n3. However, the code may require additional configuration on the target system for WinRM to be enabled and accessible.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 5\n\nPackages used: subprocess, psexec (from Impacket)\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. The code uses the subprocess module to execute psexec, which allows for remote command execution.\n2. It can be useful in situations where the target system does not have SSH or WinRM configured.\n3. However, the code relies on an external library (Impacket) and may require additional setup and dependencies.\n\nBased on the scores, Solution 2 has the highest score and can proceed with functional and unit testing.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking\n\n[Solution 2 Unit Test]\nFunctional Test:\n1. Validate that a remote PowerShell session can be established using valid credentials.\n2. Execute a simple command on the remote system and verify the output.\n\nUnit Test:\n1. Use mocking to simulate the remote system and test the functionality of the code with different scenarios, such as invalid credentials or inaccessible remote system.\n2. Verify that the code handles potential error scenarios and provides appropriate error messages.\n\nPlease note that the functional and unit tests are to be implemented in a separate code section and should be tailored to the specific requirements and environment."
