Advantages:\n   - Simple and straightforward implementation using subprocess module.\n   - Works across different platforms.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Reliant on executing shell commands, which may have security implications.\n   - Output may need additional parsing.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: pywin32\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Provides a more direct and reliable way to access the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects.\n   - Offers more control and flexibility in retrieving device information.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires installation of the pywin32 package.\n   - Restricted to Windows systems.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: psutil\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages:\n   - Uses the psutil library, which provides a cross-platform interface for retrieving system information.\n   - Relatively easy to use and does not require additional installations.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Limited to discovering information about disk partitions rather than all peripheral devices.\n   - May not provide as much detailed information as other methods.\n\nGiven the scores, the first solution with a score of 9 seems to be the most promising. Let's proceed to write the functional test and unit test code for this solution.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1120 - Peripheral Device Discovery]\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\n\nTest Code:\n\n```python\ndef test_peripheral_device_discovery():\n    devices = peripheral_device_discovery()\n    assert isinstance(devices, str), \"Devices should be a string\"\n    # Additional assertions or comparisons to validate the output can be added here\n\ntest_peripheral_device_discovery()\n```\n\nThe above code defines a functional test for the peripheral_device_discovery() function. It checks whether the returned devices variable is a string. Additional assertions can be added to validate the output further.\n\nPlease note that the original code for Solution 1 has been copied before writing the test code."
