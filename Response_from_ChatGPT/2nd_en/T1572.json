The scapy package provides high-level networking capabilities and makes protocol creation and manipulation easy.\n2. The implementation is concise and straightforward.\n3. The scapy library supports a wide range of protocols.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Limited error handling and error reporting in scapy.\n2. Not all network interfaces may be supported by scapy.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: pypacker, dpkt\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\nAdvantages:\n1. The dpkt library provides low-level packet parsing and manipulation capabilities.\n2. The pypacker library offers a high-level interface for packet construction.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. The dpkt library has a steeper learning curve compared to scapy.\n2. The implementation requires additional steps to send the packet using pypacker.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: socket\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\nAdvantages:\n1. The socket library is a built-in Python library, so there are no extra dependencies.\n2. The implementation is lightweight and does not require additional packages.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Directly manipulating packet headers using sockets can be error-prone and requires a good understanding of network protocols.\n2. Limited support for higher-level protocol manipulation compared to scapy and dpkt.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to proceed with functional and unit testing for any of the solutions!"
