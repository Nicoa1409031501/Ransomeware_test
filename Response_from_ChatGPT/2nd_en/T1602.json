Method 1:\n   Advantages:\n   - Uses multiple modules to perform file search and reading.\n   Disadvantages:\n   - Relies on external commands like 'cat' which may not be available on all systems.\n   - More complex syntax with subprocess module.\n\n2. Method 2:\n   Advantages:\n   - Uses the glob module which simplifies file search patterns.\n   - Reads file contents using the built-in `open()` function.\n   Disadvantages:\n   - Requires specifying the full path to the directory where files should be searched.\n\n3. Method 3:\n   Advantages:\n   - Uses the more modern pathlib module for file search and path handling.\n   - Simplified syntax compared to Method 1.\n   Disadvantages:\n   - Requires specifying the full path to the directory where files should be searched.\n\n[Score]: 6"
