Disadvantage: Requires file path as input, which may need to be provided manually.\n3. Disadvantage: Relies on operating system commands, which may not be portable across different systems.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: codesign\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Provides a method to sign executables using code signing materials.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires a valid signing certificate, which may not be readily available.\n3. Disadvantage: Relies on the codesign package, which may have limitations or dependencies.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: pywinauto\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Allows for modification of code signing policies on Windows systems.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires the pywinauto package, which may need to be installed separately.\n3. Disadvantage: Limited to Windows operating systems and may not be applicable to other platforms.\n\nAmong the three solutions, Solution 2 has the highest score and meets the criteria for further testing.\n\n[Feasible]\nT1553-Subvert Trust Controls Unit Test\n\n```python\n# Import the original code for testing\nimport codesign\n\ndef test_sign_executable():\n    # Test case 1: Valid executable path and signing certificate\n    executable_path = \"/path/to/executable\"\n    signing_certificate = \"Signing Certificate Name\"\n    codesign.sign(executable_path, signing_certificate)\n\n    # Add more test cases here\n\n# Run the unit test\ntest_sign_executable()\n```\n\nPlease note that the unit test code is using the original code and function name for testing purposes."
