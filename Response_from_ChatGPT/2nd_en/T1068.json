Advantage: Simple and straightforward implementation.\n2. Disadvantage: Relies on the system shell to execute the exploit command, which may have security implications.\n3. Disadvantage: Limited control over the execution environment.\n4. Disadvantage: May not work on all operating systems.\n5. Disadvantage: Requires the user to manually insert the exploit command.\n6. Disadvantage: May not handle errors and exceptions gracefully.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 6\nUsed packages: ctypes, os, sys\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantage: Provides more control over the memory allocation and execution process.\n2. Advantage: Suitable for privilege escalation on Windows systems.\n3. Disadvantage: More complex implementation compared to the first solution.\n4. Disadvantage: Requires knowledge of the shellcode and low-level Windows APIs.\n5. Disadvantage: Limited to Windows systems, not applicable to other operating systems.\n6. Disadvantage: May require special privileges to run certain commands.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: pwntools\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \n1. Advantage: Utilizes a specialized library for binary exploitation.\n2. Advantage: Provides a higher level of abstraction for privilege escalation.\n3. Advantage: Can be used for both local and remote exploitation.\n4. Disadvantage: Requires installation and setup of the pwntools library.\n5. Disadvantage: Limited to specific types of vulnerabilities and target binaries.\n6. Disadvantage: May require additional knowledge of exploit techniques and binary analysis.\n\nSince Solution 3 scored over 8, let's proceed with writing functional and unit tests for it.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation]\n[Solution 3 Unit Test]\n\nContent... - TODO: Write functional and unit tests for Solution 3."
