Advantage: Uses a widely-used and well-documented Docker SDK for Python.\n2. Disadvantage: Limited to discovering resources in Docker containers only.\n3. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound.\n4. Limited to the local Docker environment.\n\n[Solution Two]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: kubernetes\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Can discover resources in Kubernetes clusters, including pods, deployments, and nodes.\n2. Disadvantage: Requires access to a Kubernetes cluster and configuration files.\n3. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound.\n4. More comprehensive than Solution One.\n\n[Solution Three]\n[Score]: 7\nUsed packages: boto3\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: Can discover resources in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters, services, and tasks.\n2. Disadvantage: Limited to AWS ECS and requires AWS credentials.\n3. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound.\n4. Limited to AWS ECS environment.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Solution Two (using the Kubernetes Python client) has the highest score of 9. Therefore, we will proceed with writing functional and unit tests for Solution Two."
