Advantage: This solution uses built-in Python os.walk() function to recursively search for files in a directory and its subdirectories.\n2. Disadvantage: None\n\n[Solution Two]\n```python\nimport glob\n\ndef search_files(directory):\n    files = glob.glob(directory + \"/**/*\", recursive=True)\n    return files\n```\n[Score]: 8\n\nUsed packages: glob\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the glob module in Python to perform recursive file search, which can simplify the code compared to using os.walk().\n2. Disadvantage: The glob function may not work correctly on some platforms due to differences in file path representations.\n\n[Solution Three]\n```python\nimport pathlib\n\ndef search_files(directory):\n    path = pathlib.Path(directory)\n    files = [str(file) for file in path.rglob(\"*\")]\n    return files\n```\n[Score]: 9\n\nUsed packages: pathlib\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantage: This solution uses the Python pathlib module, which provides an object-oriented approach to file system operations and is recommended for modern Python code.\n2. Disadvantage: None"
