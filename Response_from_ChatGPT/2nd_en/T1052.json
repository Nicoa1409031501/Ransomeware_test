The syntax and logic of the code are correct.\n[Advantages]: \n- shutil.copy2() function ensures that the metadata (such as timestamps) of the original file are preserved.\n- Relatively simple and straightforward implementation.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Package Used]: os\n[Syntax and Logical Analysis]: The code uses the `os.system()` function to execute the `cp` command, which copies the file from the source path to the destination path. The syntax and logic of the code are correct.\n[Advantages]: \n- No need to import additional packages.\n- Works on multiple operating systems.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Package Used]: subprocess\n[Syntax and Logical Analysis]: The code uses the `subprocess.call()` function to execute the `cp` command, which copies the file from the source path to the destination path. The syntax and logic of the code are correct.\n[Advantages]: \n- Provides more control over the subprocess execution.\n- Works on multiple operating systems.\n\n[Scoring]\n[Solution 1]: \n- Used packages: shutil\n- Syntax and Logical Analysis: 10/10\n- Advantages and Disadvantages: \n    1. Advantage: Preserves file metadata.\n- Score: 10\n\n[Solution 2]: \n- Used packages: os\n- Syntax and Logical Analysis: 10/10\n- Advantages and Disadvantages: None\n- Score: 10\n\n[Solution 3]: \n- Used packages: subprocess\n- Syntax and Logical Analysis: 10/10\n- Advantages and Disadvantages: None\n- Score: 10\n\nSince all the solutions received a score of 10, we will proceed to write functional and unit test code for each solution."
