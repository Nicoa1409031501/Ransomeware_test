Advantages: \n   - Uses subprocess module to execute the exploit code, providing a secure way of running external commands.\n   - Handles the output file using file input/output operations.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires writing the exploit code separately.\n   - May have limitations depending on the complexity of the exploit code.\n\n[Solution 2]\n[Score]: 8\nUsed packages: requests\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages: \n   - Uses the requests package, a popular and widely-used library for making HTTP requests.\n   - Does not require writing the exploit code separately.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - May have limitations depending on the capabilities of the target software vulnerability.\n   - Relies on the target software vulnerability to be accessible via HTTP.\n\n[Solution 3]\n[Score]: 9\nUsed packages: paramiko\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages: \n   - Uses the paramiko package for SSH-based connections, allowing for remote execution of exploit code.\n   - Handles the SSH connection and remote execution of the exploit code.\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - Requires the target host to have SSH enabled and credentials to connect to it.\n   - May have limitations depending on the capabilities of the target software vulnerability.\n\nSince Solution 1 and Solution 3 score above 8, we will proceed to write functional test and unit test code for those solutions.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access]\n\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\nContent...\n\n[Solution 3 Unit Test]\nContent..."
