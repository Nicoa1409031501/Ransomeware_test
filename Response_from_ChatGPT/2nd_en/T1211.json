Advantages: \n   - The subprocess module provides a high-level interface to execute commands.\n   - Easy to use and can capture the output of the executed command.\n2. Disadvantages: \n   - Limited control over the execution environment.\nScore: 9\n\n[Solution 2]\nUsed packages: os\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n1. Advantages: \n   - The os module provides a low-level interface to execute commands.\n   - Allows more control over the execution environment.\n2. Disadvantages: \n   - Process execution is blocking.\n   - Limited functionality compared to subprocess.\nScore: 8\n\n[Solution 3]\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: \nN/A as it requires a specific package related to the vulnerability.\n\nSince Solution 1 has the highest score of 9, let's proceed with writing functional and unit tests for it.\n\n[Feasible]\n[T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion]\n\n[Solution 1 Unit Test]\nFunctional Test:\n1. Copy the original code from Solution 1.\n2. Write a function that simulates the vulnerability being exploited.\n3. Call the `exploit_vulnerability()` function and assert the expected behavior.\n\nUnit Test:\n1. Write unit tests for any helper functions used in the `exploit_vulnerability()` function.\n2. Mock any external dependencies to allow isolated testing.\n\nNote: Replace [Solution 1] with [Solution 1 Unit Test] in the subsequent steps for writing the test code."
