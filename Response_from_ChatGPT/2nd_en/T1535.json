        "content":"1. Evaluation:\n[Feasible]\n[T1535- Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions]\n\n[Solution One]\n- Used packages: boto3, argparse\n- Advantages: \n  1. Utilizes the boto3 library which provides a high-level interface for interacting with AWS services.\n  2. Allows for easy customization of the AWS instance creation using command line arguments.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Requires AWS credentials to be configured on the machine running the code.\n  2. Limited to AWS services and cannot be easily adapted for other cloud providers.\n  3. May require network configurations, security groups, and other settings to be configured separately.\n  \n[Solution Two]\n- Used packages: os, subprocess\n- Advantages:\n  1. Uses the popular AWS CLI to create instances, providing flexibility and access to a wide range of AWS features.\n  2. Can be easily integrated into shell scripts or executed directly from the command line.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Relies on the AWS CLI being installed and configured on the machine running the code.\n  2. Requires command string construction and execution, which may introduce security risks if input is not properly sanitized.\n  3. Limited to AWS services and cannot be easily adapted for other cloud providers.\n  \n[Solution Three]\n- Used packages: boto3\n- Advantages:\n  1. Utilizes the boto3 library which provides a high-level interface for interacting with AWS services.\n  2. Allows for custom actions based on the instances returned, providing flexibility for additional logic and functionality.\n- Disadvantages:\n  1. Requires AWS credentials to be configured on the machine running the code.\n  2. Limited to AWS services and cannot be easily adapted for other cloud providers.\n  3. May require additional code to perform the desired actions based on the instances returned.\n\n2. Scoring:\n[Solution One]\n- Score: 8\n  - Deduct 0 points for syntax and logical errors.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of requiring AWS credentials to be configured on the machine.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of being limited to AWS services.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of requiring separate network configurations and other settings.\n  \n[Solution Two]\n- Score: 7\n  - Deduct 0 points for syntax and logical errors.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of relying on the AWS CLI being installed and configured.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of requiring command string construction and execution.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of being limited to AWS services.\n  \n[Solution Three]\n- Score: 8\n  - Deduct 0 points for syntax and logical errors.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of requiring AWS credentials to be configured on the machine.\n  - Deduct 2 points for the disadvantage of being limited to AWS services.\n  - Deduct 0 points for the disadvantage of requiring additional code to perform desired actions.\n\n3. Since none of the solutions scored above 8, functional and unit testing code will not be written."
