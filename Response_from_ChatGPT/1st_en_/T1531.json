This package allows us to interact with the operating system.\n\n1. The first method is to delete a user account:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef delete_user_account(username):\n    os.system(f\"sudo userdel -r {username}\")\n```\n\nIn this method, we use the `os.system()` function to execute a command to delete the user account specified by the `username`. The `-r` flag ensures that the user's home directory and files are also removed.\n\n2. The second method is to lock a user account:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef lock_user_account(username):\n    os.system(f\"sudo usermod -L {username}\")\n```\n\nIn this method, we use the `os.system()` function to execute a command to lock the user account specified by the `username`. The `-L` flag locks the account.\n\n3. The third method is to change the user's credentials:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef change_user_credentials(username, new_password):\n    os.system(f\"sudo passwd {username} <<< {new_password}\")\n```\n\nIn this method, we use the `os.system()` function to execute a command to change the user's password. The `<<<` operator is used to redirect the `new_password` as the input to the `passwd` command.\n\nNote: These methods will require elevated privileges to execute, so the `sudo` command is used. Make sure to run the script with appropriate permissions.\n\nPlease specify which method you would like to use and provide the necessary inputs such as `username`, `new_password`, etc."
