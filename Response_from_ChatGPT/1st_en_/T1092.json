Import the required packages: os, shutil\n2. Define a function to transfer files from the source system to the destination system using removable media:\n   ```python\n   def transfer_files(source_path, destination_path):\n       shutil.copytree(source_path, destination_path)\n   ```\n3. Define a function to transfer commands: (replace 'command' with the actual command you want to execute)\n   ```python\n   def transfer_command(command):\n       os.system(command)\n   ```\n4. Call the transfer_files and transfer_command functions according to your specific requirements.\n\nMethod 2:\n1. Import the required packages: subprocess, shutil\n2. Define a function to transfer files from the source system to the destination system using removable media:\n   ```python\n   def transfer_files(source_path, destination_path):\n       subprocess.Popen([\"xcopy\", source_path, destination_path])\n   ```\n3. Define a function to transfer commands: (replace 'command' with the actual command you want to execute)\n   ```python\n   def transfer_command(command):\n       subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)\n   ```\n4. Call the transfer_files and transfer_command functions according to your specific requirements.\n\nMethod 3:\n1. Import the required packages: paramiko, scp\n2. Define a function to transfer files from the source system to the destination system using SCP:\n   ```python\n   def transfer_files(source_path, destination_path, ssh_client):\n       with scp.SCPClient(ssh_client.get_transport()) as scp_client:\n           scp_client.put(source_path, destination_path)\n   ```\n3. Define a function to transfer commands: (replace 'command' with the actual command you want to execute)\n   ```python\n   def transfer_command(command, ssh_client):\n       ssh_client.exec_command(command)\n   ```\n4. Set up an SSH connection to the destination system using paramiko SSHClient.\n5. Call the transfer_files and transfer_command functions, passing the SSH client object and other parameters as needed.\n\nNote: Since the implementation of this technique depends on the specific environment and access controls, additional customization might be required.\n\nPlease let me know if I can assist you further."
