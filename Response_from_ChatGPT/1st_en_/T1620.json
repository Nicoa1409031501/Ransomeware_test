Method 1: Using the Python ctypes library\n   - Package used: ctypes\n  \n   Code:\n   ```python\n   import ctypes\n\n   # Load the target DLL file into memory\n   dll_path = \"path/to/dll.dll\"\n   dll_handle = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(dll_path)\n   \n   # Call the exported functions or execute desired code within the loaded DLL\n   dll_handle.exported_function()\n   ```\n\n2. Method 2: Using the PyInstaller package\n   - Packages used: PyInstaller\n   \n   Code:\n   ```python\n   import PyInstaller.__main__ as pyi\n\n   # Create a Python script that contains the malicious payload or reflective code\n   payload_code = \"\"\"\n   # Malicious code here\n   \"\"\"\n\n   # Compile the Python script into an executable\n   pyi.run([\n       '--onefile',\n       '--noconsole',\n       'payload_script.py'\n   ])\n\n   # Execute the compiled payload\n   compiled_payload_path = \"dist/payload_script.exe\"\n   subprocess.call(compiled_payload_path)\n   ```\n\n3. Method 3: Using the CFFI package\n   - Package used: cffi\n   \n   Code:\n   ```python\n   import cffi\n   \n   # Create a Python script that contains the malicious payload or reflective code\n   payload_code = \"\"\"\n   # Malicious code here\n   \"\"\"\n   \n   # Define the C code that will be reflected and executed\n   c_code = f'''\n   {payload_code}\n   '''\n   \n   ffi = cffi.FFI()\n   \n   # Compile and execute the C code within the process memory\n   lib = ffi.dlopen(None)\n   ffi.cdef('int main(void);')\n   lib.main()\n   ```\n\nNote: In all three methods, please replace the paths and code according to your specific environment and requirements. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and authorizations before executing any potentially malicious code.\n\nAdditionally, please note that T1620 is a general technique that can be applied in various programming languages, not limited to Python. The code examples provided above demonstrate how to achieve reflective code loading using Python."
