The following steps outline three different methods to achieve this:\n\n1. Method 1: Using the GCP Python SDK with the default authentication method (Application Default Credentials):\n\n    Package Used: google-cloud-sdk\n    \n    Functionality Used:\n    - google.cloud.resource_manager.ResourceManagerClient: To list available services and regions.\n    - google.auth: To authenticate the SDK with the default credentials.\n\nPlease note that this method requires installing the Google Cloud SDK and configuring the authentication with the necessary permissions.\n\n2. Method 2: Using the GCP Python SDK with Service Account credentials:\n\n    Package Used: google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2, google-api-python-client\n    \n    Functionality Used:\n    - google.auth: To authenticate the SDK with Service Account credentials.\n    - googleapiclient.discovery: To create client instances for interacting with GCP services.\n    - googleapiclient.errors: To handle any errors that may occur during API calls.\n  \n3. Method 3: Using the GCP REST APIs directly:\n\n    Package Used: requests\n    \n    Functionality Used:\n    - requests.get: To make GET requests to the GCP REST API endpoints.\n    - requests.exceptions.RequestException: To handle any exceptions that may occur during the API calls.\n    \nIt's important to mention that each method requires proper authentication and access permissions to the target GCP environment.\n\nPlease let me know which method you would like me to focus on, or if you have any other preferences."
