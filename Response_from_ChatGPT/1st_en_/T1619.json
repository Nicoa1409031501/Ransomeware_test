First Method:\nTo implement the functionality of Cloud Storage Object Discovery, we can use the `boto3` package, which is the official AWS SDK for Python.\n\nHere is the code:\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef cloud_storage_object_discovery():\n    # Create a session using your AWS credentials or IAM role configuration\n    session = boto3.Session()\n    \n    # Specify the region where your cloud storage is located\n    region = 'us-west-2'\n    \n    # Create a client for the desired cloud storage service\n    s3_client = session.client('s3', region_name=region)\n    \n    # List all objects in the specified bucket\n    response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket='your-bucket-name')\n    \n    # Iterate over the objects and print their names\n    if 'Contents' in response:\n        for object in response['Contents']:\n            print(object['Key'])\n    else:\n        print(\"No objects found.\")\n\ncloud_storage_object_discovery()\n```\n\n2. Second Method:\nAnother way to implement Cloud Storage Object Discovery is by using the `google-cloud-storage` package, which is the official Google Cloud Storage SDK for Python.\n\nHere is the code:\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\ndef cloud_storage_object_discovery():\n    # Create a client for the Google Cloud Storage service\n    client = storage.Client()\n    \n    # Specify the name of the bucket where the objects are stored\n    bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n    \n    # Retrieve the bucket object\n    bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n    \n    # List all objects in the bucket\n    blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs())\n    \n    # Iterate over the objects and print their names\n    for blob in blobs:\n        print(blob.name)\n\ncloud_storage_object_discovery()\n```\n\n3. Third Method:\nFor other cloud storage providers that have a RESTful API, we can implement Cloud Storage Object Discovery using the `requests` package for making HTTP requests.\n\nHere is the code:\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef cloud_storage_object_discovery():\n    # Specify the URL of the cloud storage API\n    url = 'https://api.example.com/objects'\n    \n    # Add any required headers or authentication tokens\n    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer <your-token>'}\n    \n    # Send a GET request to retrieve the objects\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    \n    # Check if the request was successful and retrieve the objects\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        objects = response.json()\n        for object in objects:\n            print(object['name'])\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Request failed.\")\n\ncloud_storage_object_discovery()\n```\n\nPlease replace `'your-bucket-name'`, `region`, or `url` with your specific cloud storage information before running the code."
