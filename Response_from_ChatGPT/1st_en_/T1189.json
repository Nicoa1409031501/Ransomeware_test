Selenium is a powerful tool for browser automation, and requests is a widely used HTTP library. Here are three different methods to implement this technique:\n\nMethod 1: Using Selenium and Chrome WebDriver\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    # Set up Chrome WebDriver\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n    \n    # Open the target URL\n    driver.get(url)\n\n# Usage\ndrive_by_compromise(\"http://example.com\")\n```\n\nMethod 2: Using Selenium and Firefox WebDriver\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    # Set up Firefox WebDriver\n    driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n    \n    # Open the target URL\n    driver.get(url)\n\n# Usage\ndrive_by_compromise(\"http://example.com\")\n```\n\nMethod 3: Using requests\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef drive_by_compromise(url):\n    # Send a GET request to the target URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    # Process the response here\n\n# Usage\ndrive_by_compromise(\"http://example.com\")\n```\n\nIn all three methods, we can further extend the code to perform actions such as exploiting browser vulnerabilities or extracting cookies.\n\nNote: Since this is a simulated implementation, the actual exploitation steps are intentionally not included."
