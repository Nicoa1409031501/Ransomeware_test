Send a GET request to the target website's login page to retrieve the login form and session cookies.\n2. Extract the required fields from the login form (e.g., username, password, and other parameters).\n3. Send a POST request with the extracted login credentials to the login endpoint.\n4. Upon successful login, extract the session cookies from the response headers.\n5. Store the obtained session cookies for further usage.\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: selenium, webdriver_manager\n\n1. Use Selenium to automate browsing and interact with the target website.\n2. Launch a web browser (e.g., Chrome) using Selenium's WebDriver.\n3. Navigate to the target website's login page.\n4. Find the login form elements (e.g., username, password fields) using Selenium's methods (e.g., find_element_by_name, find_element_by_id).\n5. Enter the required credentials into the login form.\n6. Submit the form to log in.\n7. Retrieve the session cookies from the browser's cookie jar.\n8. Store the obtained session cookies for further usage.\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: scapy\n\n1. Use scapy to sniff network traffic within the local network.\n2. Filter the captured packets to identify HTTP traffic and extract the session cookies.\n3. Analyze the network traffic to find the cookies exchanged during the authentication process.\n4. Store the obtained session cookies for further usage.\n\nPlease let me know which method you would like to implement, or if you have any further requirements."
