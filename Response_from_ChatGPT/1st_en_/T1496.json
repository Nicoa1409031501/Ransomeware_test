Here is one possible implementation:\n\n1. Import the required packages:\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n```\n\n2. Define a function for the resource-intensive task:\n```python\ndef resource_intensive_task():\n    # Add your resource-intensive code here\n    # This could be a CPU-intensive operation, network scanning, etc.\n    # For demonstration purposes, we'll simulate a resource-intensive task by performing a large calculation\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(10**8):\n        result += i\n```\n\n3. Create a function to launch the resource-intensive tasks using multiple processes:\n```python\ndef launch_resource_hijacking(num_processes):\n    processes = []\n    for _ in range(num_processes):\n        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=resource_intensive_task)\n        process.start()\n        processes.append(process)\n\n    # Wait for all processes to finish\n    for process in processes:\n        process.join()\n```\n\n4. Call the `launch_resource_hijacking` function with the desired number of processes (e.g., 4):\n```python\nlaunch_resource_hijacking(4)\n```\n\nNote: This code will create and launch multiple processes, each performing the resource-intensive task defined in the `resource_intensive_task` function. Adjust the number of processes based on the system's capabilities and resources.\n\nAdditional implementations:\n- Alternatively, we can use the `threading` module to achieve concurrency by creating multiple threads instead of processes.\n- If the resource-intensive tasks are I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound, we can also consider using asynchronous programming with the `asyncio` module or third-party libraries like `aiohttp` or `aiofiles`.\n\nPlease note that this implementation may vary based on specific use cases and requirements."
