Install the necessary packages by running the following command:\n   ```python\n   pip install pyotp\n   ```\n\n2. Import the required packages:\n   ```python\n   import pyotp\n   import smtplib\n   from email.mime.text import MIMEText\n   ```\n\n3. Define a function to generate an OTP token:\n   ```python\n   def generate_otp_token():\n       # Create a temporary secret key (this should be randomly generated and securely stored for each user, for simplicity, we'll use a static key here)\n       secret_key = 'MySecretKey123'\n       \n       # Generate an OTP token based on the secret key\n       totp = pyotp.TOTP(secret_key)\n       \n       # Get the current OTP token\n       otp_token = totp.now()\n       \n       return otp_token\n   ```\n\n4. Define a function to send an email with the OTP token:\n   ```python\n   def send_otp_email(email, otp_token):\n       # Sender and receiver email addresses\n       sender = 'sender@example.com'\n       receiver = email\n       \n       # Email subject\n       subject = 'Multi-Factor Authentication Code'\n       \n       # Email body with the OTP token\n       body = f'Your Multi-Factor Authentication code is: {otp_token}'\n       \n       # Create the email message\n       message = MIMEText(body)\n       message['Subject'] = subject\n       message['From'] = sender\n       message['To'] = receiver\n       \n       # Send the email using SMTP server\n       smtp_server = 'smtp.example.com'\n       smtp_port = 587\n       smtp_username = 'smtp_username'\n       smtp_password = 'smtp_password'\n       \n       with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:\n           server.starttls()\n           server.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)\n           server.sendmail(sender, receiver, message.as_string())\n   ```\n\n5. Test the functionality by calling the functions:\n   ```python\n   email = 'user@example.com'\n   otp_token = generate_otp_token()\n   send_otp_email(email, otp_token)\n   ```\n\nNote: Please make sure to replace the placeholders (such as email addresses, SMTP server details, etc.) with the actual values relevant to your environment.\n\nRemember to follow security best practices, such as securely storing the secret keys and implementing additional security measures to protect against adversaries attempting to bypass MFA mechanisms."
