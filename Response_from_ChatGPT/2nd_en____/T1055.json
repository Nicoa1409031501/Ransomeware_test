        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1: DLL Injection\n- The code correctly loads the target process and opens it for writing.\n- The memory allocation for the DLL path in the target process is done correctly using `VirtualAllocEx`.\n- The DLL path is correctly written to the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory`.\n- The address of the `LoadLibraryA` function is retrieved correctly using `GetProcAddress`.\n- The code creates a remote thread in the target process to call `LoadLibraryA` with the address of the DLL path.\n\nMethod 2: PE Injection\n- The code correctly opens the target process for writing.\n- The memory allocation in the target process for the PE file is done correctly using `VirtualAllocEx`.\n- The PE file is correctly read into a buffer.\n- The PE file is correctly written to the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory`.\n- The address of the entry point of the injected PE file needs to be manually specified.\n- The code creates a remote thread in the target process to jump to the entry point of the injected PE file.\n\nMethod 3: Thread Execution Hijacking\n- The code correctly opens the target process and target thread for writing.\n- The target thread is correctly suspended using `SuspendThread`.\n- The context of the target thread is correctly retrieved using `GetThreadContext`.\n- The instruction pointer (EIP) in the context is correctly modified to the specified start address.\n- The modified context is correctly set back to the target thread using `SetThreadContext`.\n- The hijacked thread is correctly resumed using `ResumeThread`.\n\nOverall, the code for each method appears to be correct and functional. However, please note that the functionality of these methods is related to process injection, which can be used for malicious purposes. Use caution when testing or implementing such code."
