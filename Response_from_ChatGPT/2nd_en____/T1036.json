This step needs to be implemented for the method to be fully functional. Other than that, the code looks fine.\n\nMethod 2:\n- The code for Method 2 generates a disguised file name, but it does not actually save any file using that name. The code needs to be completed by adding the logic to save a file with the generated name.\n\nMethod 3:\n- The code for Method 3 appears to be correct and functional.\n\nOverall, the provided code for the unit tests is partially complete and requires further development to fully function."
