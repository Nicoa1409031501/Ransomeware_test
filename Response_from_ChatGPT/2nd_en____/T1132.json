        "content":"Code Review:\n\n1. Method 1: Base64 Encoding\nThe base64_encode function takes data as input and encodes it using the base64 encode function from the base64 package. The encoded data is then returned. The base64_decode function takes the previously encoded data as input, decodes it using the base64 decode function, and then returns the decoded data. Both functions appear to be correctly implemented and functional.\n\n2. Method 2: Base64 Encoding with Gzip Compression\nThe base64_gzip_encode function takes data as input, compresses it using the zlib compress function, encodes the compressed data using the base64 encode function, and returns the encoded data. The base64_gzip_decode function takes the previously encoded data as input, decodes it using the base64 decode function, decompresses the decoded data using the zlib decompress function, and returns the decompressed data. Both functions appear to be correctly implemented and functional.\n\n3. Method 3: Non-standard Data Encoding\nThe non_standard_encode and non_standard_decode functions are placeholders for non-standard data encoding and decoding algorithms. These functions need to be implemented separately with custom algorithms to fit the specific requirements. As mentioned in the code comments, you will need to replace the custom_encoding_algorithm and custom_decoding_algorithm function calls with your own implementation. These functions are not functional in the provided code and need further implementation.\n\nOverall, the code for Base64 Encoding and Base64 Encoding with Gzip Compression is functional and well-implemented. However, the non-standard encoding and decoding methods need to be developed separately based on specific requirements."
