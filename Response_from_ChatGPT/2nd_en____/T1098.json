        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1: `add_adversary_credentials`\n- The code is using the appropriate AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to interact with the AWS API.\n- The function assumes the presence of adversary-controlled credentials and a target cloud account's role ARN.\n- The code could benefit from error handling, such as handling exceptions raised during API calls and proper handling of responses.\n- Consider returning the response or any relevant information instead of printing it directly.\n\nMethod 2: `grant_additional_permissions`\n- The code is using the Office365-REST-Python-Client library to interact with the Office 365 APIs.\n- The function assumes the presence of adversary-controlled email account credentials and the ability to authenticate and grant additional permissions.\n- The code does not handle potential authentication errors or API call failures.\n- Consider providing more meaningful error messages or error-raising mechanism in case of authentication failures or other issues.\n\nMethod 3: `add_additional_roles`\n- The code is using the Google API Python client library to interact with the Google IAM API.\n- The function assumes the presence of adversary-controlled cloud account credentials and the ability to authenticate and add additional roles or permissions.\n- The code does not handle potential authentication errors or API call failures.\n- Consider providing more meaningful error messages or error-raising mechanism in case of authentication failures or other issues.\n- Ensure that the necessary permissions and access are granted to the credentials used to interact with the Google IAM API.\n\nOverall, the code for each method appears to address the corresponding techniques in the T1098 category. However, there is room for improvement in error handling and handling authentication failures or other potential issues."
