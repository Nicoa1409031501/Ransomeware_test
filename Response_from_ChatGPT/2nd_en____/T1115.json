        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1: \nThe code looks good and is using the clipboard package to get the data from the clipboard and write it to a file. It is a simple and straightforward implementation.\n\nMethod 2:\nThis method uses the pyperclip package, which is another popular package for clipboard functionality. The code is similar to Method 1 but uses a different package.\n\nMethod 3:\nThis method uses the win32clipboard package, which is specific to Windows. It directly accesses the Win32 API to get the clipboard data. The code is a bit more complex compared to the previous methods, but it offers more control if needed.\n\nOverall, all three methods are valid and should work based on the respective packages used. You can choose the method that suits your requirements and operating system."
