        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1:\nThe code looks fine and follows the recommended approach of using ctypes to access native APIs. However, it would be better to wrap the native API call in a function for better code organization.\n\nMethod 2:\nThe code also looks good and achieves the same result as Method 1 but using the pywin32 library. Again, it would be better to encapsulate the native API call in a function.\n\nMethod 3:\nThe code is more advanced and demonstrates the usage of win32api.LoadLibrary(), win32api.GetProcAddress(), and ctypes.CFUNCTYPE() to dynamically load a library and get the address of a function. However, it would be good to add error handling in case the library or function cannot be loaded.\n\nOverall, the code follows good practices and effectively demonstrates the usage of native APIs in different ways. It can be improved by encapsulating the native API calls in functions and adding error handling."
