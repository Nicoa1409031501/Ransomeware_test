        "content":"Code Review:\n\n1. Overall, the code structure is well-organized with clear functions for each functionality.\n\n2. The use of the `requests` package for making requests via an external proxy is appropriate and efficient.\n\n3. The `socket` package is used correctly to establish connections and send/receive data for redirecting command and control traffic using an internal proxy.\n\n4. The implementation of chaining multiple proxies together is logical and easy to follow.\n\n5. In the `domain_fronting` function, the headers are correctly set to specify the real domain for domain fronting.\n\n6. It would be beneficial to add error handling and validation for input parameters, such as validating the format of IP addresses and ports, and handling exceptions for connection failures or invalid responses.\n\n7. Consider adding logging statements or error messages to provide more informative output during testing and troubleshooting.\n\n8. It's recommended to write unit tests for each of these functions to ensure their functionality and handle various scenarios.\n\nOverall, the code looks good, but it would be beneficial to add error handling, proper input validation, and unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness."
