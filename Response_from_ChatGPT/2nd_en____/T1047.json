        "content":"Unit Test Proposal:\n\nFor each method, a unit test can be created to verify its functionality. The unit test will check if the methods are able to execute the WMI command/query successfully and display the expected output.\n\nHere is an example of a unit test for the first method (execute_wmi_command):\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom io import StringIO\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nfrom wmi_helper import execute_wmi_command\n\nclass TestExecuteWmiCommand(unittest.TestCase):\n    \n    @patch('sys.stdout', new_callable=StringIO)\n    def test_execute_wmi_command(self, mock_stdout):\n        expected_output = \"Sample output from WMI command\"\n        mock_result = [\n            {\"Property1\": \"Value1\"},\n            {\"Property2\": \"Value2\"}\n        ]\n        \n        with patch('wmi.WMI') as mock_wmi:\n            mock_instance = mock_wmi.return_value\n            mock_instance.execquery.return_value = mock_result\n            \n            # Call the method\n            execute_wmi_command(\"SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name='cmd.exe'\")\n            \n            # Check if the WMI command was executed correctly\n            mock_instance.execquery.assert_called_once_with(\n                \"SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name='cmd.exe'\"\n            )\n            \n            # Check if the output was printed correctly\n            self.assertEqual(mock_stdout.getvalue().strip(), str(mock_result))\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just an example for the first method. Similar unit tests can be created for the other methods as well. The purpose of the unit test is to verify that the methods are functioning as expected and providing the desired output.\n\nCode Review:\n\nThe code provided for the three methods seems to be well-structured and written. The functionality of executing WMI commands/queries using different packages is implemented correctly.\n\nHowever, there are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Error Handling: The current error handling mechanism in the methods is limited to printing the error message. It would be beneficial to raise exceptions or return appropriate error messages so that the calling code can handle the errors more effectively.\n\n2. Input Validation: The methods assume that the command/query provided as input is in the correct format. It would be good to validate the input and provide appropriate error messages if the input format is invalid.\n\n3. Logging: Consider adding logging statements in the methods to capture any important information or events during the execution of the WMI commands/queries. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, the code is functional and meets the requirements. The unit tests and code review help ensure the reliability and correctness of the methods."
