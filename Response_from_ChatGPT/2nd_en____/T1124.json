        "content":"Code Review for Method 1:\nThe implementation looks good. It uses the datetime module to retrieve the current system time. The code is straightforward, and there are no apparent issues or errors. However, it would be helpful to add some error handling in case there are any exceptions while retrieving the system time.\n\nCode Review for Method 2:\nThe implementation is also correct, and it provides the system time in a specific format using the time module. The code seems to be error-free and straightforward. However, similar to Method 1, it would be beneficial to add error handling to account for any exceptions that may occur.\n\nCode Review for Method 3:\nThis method adds an additional package, pytz, to retrieve the system time with timezone information. It is a good approach if you need the time with specific timezone details. The code looks fine with no apparent issues or errors. However, as always, it would be beneficial to include error handling to handle any exceptions that may arise.\n\nIn terms of unit testing, each method should be tested to ensure that it returns the system time accurately and without any errors. The unit tests should cover scenarios such as normal system time retrieval, handling of exceptions, and verifying the format of the returned time."
