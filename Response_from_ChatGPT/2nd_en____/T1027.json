However, it would be beneficial to handle any potential exceptions that might occur while reading the file or encoding its contents.\n\nMethod 2:\nThe code for obfuscating Python code using pyarmor is simple and straightforward. No issues found during the code review.\n\nMethod 3:\nThe code for hiding and retrieving data from an image file using the stegano package seems to be correct. However, please ensure that the image files are handled properly (such as checking if the file exists before attempting to hide or retrieve data).\n\nOverall, the code for all three methods looks good. The only suggestion is to handle potential exceptions and errors to ensure robustness and reliability."
