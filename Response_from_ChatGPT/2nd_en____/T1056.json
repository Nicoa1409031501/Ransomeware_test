Below is the revised response.\n\n[Feasible]\n\nUnit Test Plan:\n\n1. Test Input Capture Listener - pynput\n   - Mock keyboard input using pynput events\n   - Verify that the captured key matches the expected value\n   - Repeat the above steps for multiple test cases to cover various scenarios (e.g., different keys, special characters)\n\n2. Test Input Capture Hook - pyHook, ctypes\n   - Emulate a low-level keyboard event using pyHook\n   - Verify that the captured key matches the expected value\n   - Repeat the above steps for multiple test cases to cover various scenarios (e.g., different keys, special characters)\n\n3. Test Input Capture Event - keyboard\n   - Mock keyboard events using the keyboard package\n   - Verify that the captured key matches the expected value\n   - Repeat the above steps for multiple test cases to cover various scenarios (e.g., different keys, special characters)\n\nPlease note that unit testing tools such as unittest or pytest can be used to implement the above test cases. Since the provided code snippets are not complete, the unit tests can be written based on the outlined approach.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response."
