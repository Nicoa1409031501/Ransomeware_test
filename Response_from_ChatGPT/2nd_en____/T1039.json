        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1:\n- The code is well-structured and easy to read.\n- The usage of `os.walk` allows for a recursive search through directories.\n- However, the implementation does not handle any potential errors during the search process, such as permission issues.\n- It might be beneficial to include error handling and robust error messages for better usability.\n\n\nMethod 2:\n- The code is concise and uses the `glob` module to simplify the search.\n- The recursive search is performed using the `**` wildcard pattern.\n- Again, error handling could be improved to handle potential exceptions that may occur during execution.\n\n\nMethod 3:\n- This method utilizes the `findstr` command-line tool through the `subprocess` module.\n- It might provide a more efficient search if executed on a Windows system.\n- However, it relies on the Windows-specific tool and may not be portable across different operating systems.\n- It is important to sanitize the `root_dir` and `target_file` inputs to prevent any potential command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n\nOverall, the implementations appear to be functionally correct and should successfully search for files on network shares. However, it is recommended to add error handling and input validation to enhance the robustness and security of the code."
