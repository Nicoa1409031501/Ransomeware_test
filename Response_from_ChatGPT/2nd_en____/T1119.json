Method 1 (automated_collection_method1):\n   - The method is implemented correctly and follows the given requirements.\n   - It searches for files in the source directory based on the provided criteria and copies them to the destination directory.\n   - The method includes a loop with a sleep function, allowing it to continuously collect data at the specified interval.\n   - The code could benefit from adding error handling in case of any exceptions during file copying.\n\n2. Method 2 (automated_collection_method2):\n   - The method is implemented correctly and achieves the same functionality as the first method but using a different approach.\n   - It uses the glob package to search for files in the source directory, and shutil to copy them to the destination directory.\n   - Like the previous method, it includes a loop with a sleep function for continuous data collection.\n   - Similarly, adding error handling would make the code more robust.\n\n3. Method 3 (automated_collection_method3):\n   - The method is implemented correctly, but it takes a different approach by utilizing AWS S3 APIs to collect data.\n   - It requires the boto3 package to communicate with the S3 service.\n   - The code currently copies the file within the same bucket. If the intention is to copy the files to another bucket or location, modifications are required (uncommenting the lines for downloading the file and specify the destination).\n   - As with the other methods, error handling should be added for smoother and more resilient execution.\n\nOverall, the code for all three methods is well-structured and meets the requirements of automated collection. The methods can be further enhanced by adding appropriate error handling and handling potential exceptions during file copying or communication with the S3 service."
