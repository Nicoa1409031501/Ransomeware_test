        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1:\n- Good use of the psutil package to iterate over running processes.\n- It would be more useful to return the process details as a list or dictionary, instead of printing them directly.\n- Add docstrings to describe the function and its purpose.\n\nMethod 2:\n- Correct usage of the wmi package to query process information.\n- Similar to Method 1, returning the process details would be more flexible.\n- Consider handling any exceptions that may occur during the WMI queries.\n\nMethod 3:\n- The subprocess module is used effectively to execute the 'tasklist' command.\n- Parsing the output and storing the process details in a dictionary is a good approach.\n- Again, consider returning the details instead of printing them directly.\n\nOverall, the proposed methods for process discovery are feasible and provide different options. However, improvements can be made to make the functions more reusable by returning the process details instead of printing them directly."
