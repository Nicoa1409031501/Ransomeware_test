The code handles exceptions and provides error messages if the task creation fails. However, the code does not provide any validation or checks for the inputs, such as ensuring the schedule time is in the correct format or the command exists.\n\nTo improve the code:\n1. Add input validation and error handling for invalid inputs.\n2. Consider using a library like `schedule` to handle scheduling tasks instead of relying on system utilities directly.\n\nIt is recommended to implement the suggested improvements to ensure the code's robustness and reliability."
