        "content":"Code Review:\n\nMethod 1:\nThe code looks fine and uses the os library to check for removable media. However, the function GetDriveType() is not defined and needs to be imported from the ctypes library.\n\nMethod 2:\nThe code uses the wmi library to check for removable media. It looks good and does not require any additional changes.\n\nMethod 3:\nThe code uses the ctypes library to check for removable media. It also looks fine, but the ctypes library is not imported in the code. Please add the following line at the beginning of the code:\n\nimport ctypes\n\nOverall, the code for all three methods is correct, but there are some minor issues that need to be addressed."
