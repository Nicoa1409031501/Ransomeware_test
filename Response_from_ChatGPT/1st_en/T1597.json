Use the requests library to make an HTTP request to a threat intelligence vendor's website.\n2. Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML response and extract relevant data.\n3. Store the extracted data in a file or database for further analysis.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef search_closed_sources():\n    url = \"https://example.com/threat_intelligence\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"html.parser\")\n    data = soup.find_all(\"div\", class_=\"data\")\n    \n    # Process and store the extracted data\n    with open(\"closed_sources_data.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n        for item in data:\n            f.write(item.text + \"\\n\")\n\nsearch_closed_sources()\n```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: selenium, webdriver_manager\n\n1. Use the selenium library to automate the browsing process.\n2. Use the webdriver_manager package to manage the browser driver.\n3. Search for threat intelligence vendors or databases using a search engine.\n4. Automate the browsing process to navigate to the vendor's website and extract relevant data.\n5. Store the extracted data in a file or database for further analysis.\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager\n\ndef search_closed_sources():\n    search_term = \"threat intelligence vendor\"\n    \n    # Set up the Chrome webdriver\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())\n    \n    # Search for threat intelligence vendors\n    driver.get(\"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" + search_term)\n    \n    # Extract relevant data from search results\n    data = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(\"div.result\")\n    \n    # Process and store the extracted data\n    with open(\"closed_sources_data.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n        for item in data:\n            f.write(item.text + \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Close the webdriver\n    driver.quit()\n\nsearch_closed_sources()\n```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: pandas, openpyxl\n\n1. Use pandas to read data from a spreadsheet containing threat intelligence vendor information.\n2. Process the data to extract relevant information.\n3. Store the extracted data in a file or database for further analysis.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef search_closed_sources():\n    # Read threat intelligence vendor information from a spreadsheet\n    data = pd.read_excel(\"vendors.xlsx\")\n\n    # Process and store the extracted data\n    with open(\"closed_sources_data.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n        for index, row in data.iterrows():\n            f.write(row[\"vendor_name\"] + \" - \" + row[\"additional_info\"] + \"\\n\")\n\nsearch_closed_sources()\n```\n\nIn all three methods, the extracted data is stored in a file named \"closed_sources_data.txt\"."
