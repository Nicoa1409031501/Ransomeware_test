Here's the implementation:\n\n1. Install the required package:\n   - No additional packages are required for this implementation.\n\n2. Import the necessary modules:\n```python\nimport socket\nimport time\n```\n\n3. Define a function for network service discovery:\n```python\ndef network_service_discovery(target_ip, start_port, end_port):\n    open_ports = []\n    \n    # Loop through the range of ports\n    for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):\n        # Create a socket object\n        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n        sock.settimeout(2)  # Set a timeout value for the socket\n        \n        # Attempt to establish a connection\n        result = sock.connect_ex((target_ip, port))\n        \n        # Check if the port is open\n        if result == 0:\n            open_ports.append(port)\n        \n        # Close the socket\n        sock.close()\n        \n        # Add a delay between port scans\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n    \n    return open_ports\n```\n\n4. Call the function with the target IP and port range:\n```python\ntarget_ip = '192.168.1.1'\nstart_port = 1\nend_port = 100\n\nopen_ports = network_service_discovery(target_ip, start_port, end_port)\nprint(\"Open ports:\", open_ports)\n```\n\nNote: This implementation will perform a TCP connect scan on the specified range of ports. It will return a list of open ports on the target IP.\n\nDisclaimer: Network scanning without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have proper permission to perform network scans before using this code.\n\nThe code uses the socket module to create a socket object for each port in the specified range. It then attempts to establish a connection to the target IP and port using the connect_ex() method. If the result is 0, it means the connection was successfully established and the port is open. The open ports are stored in a list and returned at the end.\n\nTo test the implementation, you can replace the 'target_ip', 'start_port', and 'end_port' variables with the desired values."
