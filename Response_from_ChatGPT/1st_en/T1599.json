This package allows us to modify packet headers and perform network-level attacks.\n\n1. Import the necessary packages:\n\n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n```\n\n2. Method 1: Bridging network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices:\n\n   - This method involves compromising perimeter network devices to create a bridge between trusted and untrusted networks.\n\n```python\ndef compromise_perimeter_devices():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n```\n\n3. Method 2: Bridging network boundaries by compromising internal devices responsible for network segmentation:\n\n   - This method involves compromising internal devices that are responsible for network segmentation to create a bridge between trusted and untrusted networks.\n\n```python\ndef compromise_internal_devices():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n```\n\n4. Method 3: Bridging network boundaries by modifying a network device's NAT configuration:\n\n   - This method involves modifying the NAT configuration of a network device to bypass traffic routing restrictions.\n\n```python\ndef modify_nat_configuration():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation of these methods will depend on the specific network environment and devices being used. It is crucial to ensure that any actions taken do not violate any legal or ethical boundaries and are carried out with appropriate authorization."
