Also, be cautious when deleting user accounts as it may have unintended consequences.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it like this:\n```python\ndelete_user_account(\"username\")\n```\n\nPlease replace \"username\" with the actual username you want to delete.\n\nReferences:\n1. os module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html\n2. subprocess module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html\n3. wmi module: https://pypi.org/project/WMI/"
