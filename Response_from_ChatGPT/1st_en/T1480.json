Generate an encryption/decryption key based on environment-specific conditions.\n2. Use the generated key to encrypt or decrypt payloads or any other features of malware.\n3. Execution or action is constrained to a specific target environment.\n\n```\nimport cryptography\n\ndef execute_guardrails():\n    # Use specific types of values in the environment to generate a key\n    key = cryptography.generate_key()\n\n    # Use the key to encrypt or decrypt payloads\n    encrypted_payload = cryptography.encrypt(payload, key)\n    decrypted_payload = cryptography.decrypt(encrypted_payload, key)\n\n    # Execute actions based on the decrypted payload\n    execute_actions(decrypted_payload)\n\n    return\n```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: os\nFunctionality:\n1. Check for specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.\n2. Constrain execution or actions based on the presence of these environment-specific conditions.\n\n```\nimport os\n\ndef execute_guardrails():\n    # Check for specific network share names\n    if os.path.exists('\\\\\\\\server\\\\share'):\n        # Constrain execution or actions based on the presence of the network share\n\n    # Check for attached physical devices\n    devices = os.listdir('/dev')\n    if 'device_name' in devices:\n        # Constrain execution or actions based on the presence of the physical device\n\n    # Check for specific files\n    if os.path.exists('/path/to/file'):\n        # Constrain execution or actions based on the presence of the file\n\n    # Check for joined AD domains\n    domains = os.system('Get-ADDomain')\n    if 'domain_name' in domains:\n        # Constrain execution or actions based on the joined AD domain\n\n    # Check IP addresses\n    ips = os.system('ipconfig')\n    if 'ip_address' in ips:\n        # Constrain execution or actions based on the IP address\n\n    return\n```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: none\nFunctionality:\n1. Use environment-specific conditions to validate the intended target system before executing.\n2. Reduce collateral damage from the adversary's campaign.\n\n```\ndef execute_guardrails():\n    # Validate the intended target system\n    if is_valid_target():\n        # Execute payload against the intended target\n        execute_payload()\n\n    return\n\ndef is_valid_target():\n    # Validate environment-specific conditions\n    if specific_network_share_exists() and attached_device_detected() and specific_file_exists() and ad_domain_joined() and specific_ip_address_detected():\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef execute_payload():\n    # Execute payload against the intended target\n    return\n```\n\nNote: The above code snippets are just examples to demonstrate the concept of Execution Guardrails. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements."
