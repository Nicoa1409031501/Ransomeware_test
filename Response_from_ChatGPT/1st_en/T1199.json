        "content":"[Feasible]\n\nT1199-Trusted Relationship:\n\nMethod 1:\nPackages used: None\nFunctionality: Using a simple file I/O approach to demonstrate the concept\n\n1. Create a file named \"trusted_relationship.txt\" and add the necessary information in the file, such as the details of the trusted relationship.\n2. Read the contents of the \"trusted_relationship.txt\" file to access the necessary information.\n\nCode:\n\n```\ndef trusted_relationship():\n    # Write trusted relationship details to file\n    with open('trusted_relationship.txt', 'w') as file:\n        file.write('Trusted Relationship Details')\n\n    # Read trusted relationship details from file\n    with open('trusted_relationship.txt', 'r') as file:\n        relationship_details = file.read()\n    \n    # Print the trusted relationship details\n    print(relationship_details)\n\n# Calling the function\ntrusted_relationship()\n```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: csv module\nFunctionality: Store and retrieve trusted relationship details from a CSV file.\n\n1. Create a CSV file named \"trusted_relationship.csv\" with suitable headers and add the necessary information.\n2. Read the CSV file to access the trusted relationship details.\n\nCode:\n\n```\nimport csv\n\ndef trusted_relationship():\n    # Write trusted relationship details to a CSV file\n    with open('trusted_relationship.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n        writer = csv.writer(file)\n        writer.writerow(['Header 1', 'Header 2'])  # Add suitable headers\n        writer.writerow(['Value 1', 'Value 2'])  # Add trusted relationship details\n\n    # Read trusted relationship details from the CSV file\n    with open('trusted_relationship.csv', 'r') as file:\n        reader = csv.reader(file)\n        for row in reader:\n            relationship_details = row\n    \n    # Print the trusted relationship details\n    print(relationship_details)\n\n# Calling the function\ntrusted_relationship()\n```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: configparser module\nFunctionality: Store and retrieve trusted relationship details from a configuration file.\n\n1. Create a configuration file named \"trusted_relationship.ini\" and add the necessary information.\n2. Read the configuration file to access the trusted relationship details.\n\nCode:\n\n```\nimport configparser\n\ndef trusted_relationship():\n    # Write trusted relationship details to a configuration file\n    config = configparser.ConfigParser()\n    config['Relationship'] = {'Parameter 1': 'Value 1', 'Parameter 2': 'Value 2'}\n    with open('trusted_relationship.ini', 'w') as file:\n        config.write(file)\n\n    # Read trusted relationship details from the configuration file\n    config = configparser.ConfigParser()\n    config.read('trusted_relationship.ini')\n    relationship_details = dict(config.items('Relationship'))\n\n    # Print the trusted relationship details\n    print(relationship_details)\n\n# Calling the function\ntrusted_relationship()\n```\n\nNote: In all three methods, the function `trusted_relationship()` is called to execute the implementation."
