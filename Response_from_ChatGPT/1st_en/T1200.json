Use the subprocess module to execute commands on the remote system.\n3. Use the 'lshw' command to gather hardware information on the remote system.\n4. Parse the output of the 'lshw' command to identify any additional hardware additions.\n5. Display the identified hardware additions.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef get_hardware_additions():\n    # Remote SSH connection details\n    remote_username = \"username\"\n    remote_host = \"remote_host\"\n    \n    # SSH command to execute 'lshw' and get hardware information\n    ssh_command = f\"ssh {remote_username}@{remote_host} lshw\"\n    \n    # Execute the SSH command and get the output\n    output = subprocess.check_output(ssh_command, shell=True).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    \n    # Parse the output to identify hardware additions\n    hardware_additions = []\n    lines = output.split(\"\\n\")\n    for line in lines:\n        if \"description\" in line.lower():\n            hardware_additions.append(line.split(\":\")[-1].strip())\n    \n    return hardware_additions\n\n# Usage\nhardware_additions = get_hardware_additions()\nfor addition in hardware_additions:\n    print(addition)\n```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages Used: psutil\n\n1. Use the psutil package to gather system information.\n2. Iterate over the list of connected USB devices.\n3. Identify any additional hardware additions connected via USB.\n4. Display the identified hardware additions.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport psutil\n\ndef get_hardware_additions():\n    # Get list of connected USB devices\n    connected_usb_devices = []\n    for device in psutil.disk_partitions(all=True):\n        if \"usb\" in device.opts:\n            connected_usb_devices.append(device.device)\n\n    return connected_usb_devices\n\n# Usage\nhardware_additions = get_hardware_additions()\nfor addition in hardware_additions:\n    print(addition)\n```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages Used: wmi\n\n1. Use the wmi package to gather system information.\n2. Query the Win32_PnPEntity WMI class to retrieve information about connected hardware devices.\n3. Identify any additional hardware additions in the retrieved data.\n4. Display the identified hardware additions.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport wmi\n\ndef get_hardware_additions():\n    c = wmi.WMI()\n\n    # Query the Win32_PnPEntity class to retrieve hardware device information\n    hardware_devices = c.Win32_PnPEntity()\n\n    # Filter and extract additional hardware additions\n    additional_hardware_additions = []\n    for device in hardware_devices:\n        # Modify the condition as per specific hardware addition criteria (e.g., based on manufacturer, model, etc.)\n        if \"additional_hardware\" in device.Caption:\n            additional_hardware_additions.append(device.Caption)\n\n    return additional_hardware_additions\n\n# Usage\nhardware_additions = get_hardware_additions()\nfor addition in hardware_additions:\n    print(addition)\n```\n\nNote: The above code examples are for illustrative purposes and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements and hardware detection criteria."
