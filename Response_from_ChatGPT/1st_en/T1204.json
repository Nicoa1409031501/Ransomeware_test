Since this technique involves different scenarios, we will create separate functions for each one.\n\nMethod 1: Malicious Link\nPackages used:\n- None\n\n```python\ndef malicious_link():\n    link = input(\"Enter a malicious link: \")\n    print(\"Executing code from:\", link)\n\nmalicious_link()\n```\n\nMethod 2: Malicious File\nPackages used:\n- None\n\n```python\ndef malicious_file():\n    file = input(\"Enter the path to a malicious file: \")\n    print(\"Opening and executing file:\", file)\n\nmalicious_file()\n```\n\nMethod 3: Backdoored Image\nPackages used:\n- None\n\n```python\ndef backdoored_image():\n    image = input(\"Enter the name of a backdoored image: \")\n    print(\"Running backdoored image:\", image)\n\nbackdoored_image()\n```\n\nNote: Since these methods involve user input, it is crucial to exercise caution and run the code only with trusted inputs.\n\nThese functions demonstrate the different ways an adversary may gain execution through user actions."
