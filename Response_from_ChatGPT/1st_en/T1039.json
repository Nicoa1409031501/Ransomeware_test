These libraries will allow us to interact with the operating system and perform various file and directory operations.\n\nHere's a possible implementation using three different methods:\n\nMethod 1:\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef search_network_shared_drive(path):\n    result = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):\n        for file in files:\n            result.append(os.path.join(root, file))\n    return result\n\n# Usage example\nshare_path = '\\\\\\\\server\\\\share'\n# or\nshare_path = '//server/share'\nsearch_result = search_network_shared_drive(share_path)\nprint(search_result)\n```\n\nMethod 2:\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef search_network_shared_drive(path):\n    result = []\n    try:\n        output = subprocess.check_output(['dir', '/s', '/b', path], shell=True)\n        result = output.decode().splitlines()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n    return result\n\n# Usage example\nshare_path = '\\\\\\\\server\\\\share'\n# or\nshare_path = '//server/share'\nsearch_result = search_network_shared_drive(share_path)\nprint(search_result)\n```\n\nMethod 3:\n```python\nimport pathlib\n\ndef search_network_shared_drive(path):\n    result = []\n    for file in pathlib.Path(path).rglob('*'):\n        if file.is_file():\n            result.append(str(file))\n    return result\n\n# Usage example\nshare_path = '\\\\\\\\server\\\\share'\n# or\nshare_path = '//server/share'\nsearch_result = search_network_shared_drive(share_path)\nprint(search_result)\n```\n\nIn all three methods, we are searching for files recursively starting from the specified network share path. The result is a list of file paths that can be analyzed further or used for exfiltration.\n\nPlease note that for Method 2, the command used ('dir') may need to be adjusted if you are using a non-Windows operating system. Additionally, Method 2 and Method 3 may require additional permissions or configuration settings to access the network shared drive."
