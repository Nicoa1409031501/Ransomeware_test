Method 1: Modifying the system image file on disk\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionalities used: File operations (`open()`, `write()`, `close()`)\n   - Steps:\n        1. Open the system image file for modification\n        2. Make the necessary changes to the file content\n        3. Save the modified file\n        4. Close the file\n\n2. Method 2: Modifying the system image file in memory during runtime\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionalities used: Read from and write to memory\n   - Steps:\n        1. Load the system image into memory\n        2. Modify the necessary portions in memory\n        3. Save the modified image back to memory\n        4. Flush the modified image to disk if required\n\n3. Method 3: Installing an older version of the operating system\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionalities used: None\n   - Steps:\n        1. Obtain the older version of the operating system image\n        2. Replace the existing operating system image with the older version\n        3. Restart the network device for the changes to take effect\n\nNote: The actual implementation will depend on the specific embedded network device architecture and how the system image is stored and loaded. Therefore, the code provided here is a high-level outline of the steps involved, and adjustments may be needed to fit the target system."
