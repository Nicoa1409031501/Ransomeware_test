Create a function called data_staged that takes the following parameters:\n   - source_files: a list of file paths representing the collected data\n   - destination: a string representing the staging location directory\n   \n2. Inside the function, use the shutil module to copy the files from the source_files to the destination directory:\n   \n   ```python\n   import shutil\n   \n   def data_staged(source_files, destination):\n       for file_path in source_files:\n           shutil.copy(file_path, destination)\n   ```\n\nMethod 2:\nPackages used: subprocess\n\n3. Create a function called data_staged that takes the following parameters:\n   - source_files: a list of file paths representing the collected data\n   - destination: a string representing the staging location directory\n   \n4. Inside the function, use the subprocess module to execute the appropriate command to copy the files from the source_files to the destination directory:\n   \n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n   \n   def data_staged(source_files, destination):\n       for file_path in source_files:\n           subprocess.run(['cp', file_path, destination])\n   ```\n\nMethod 3:\nPackages used: shutil, glob\n\n5. Create a function called data_staged that takes the following parameters:\n   - source_directory: a string representing the directory where the collected data is stored\n   - destination: a string representing the staging location directory\n   \n6. Inside the function, use the glob module to get the list of files in the source_directory and then use the shutil module to copy the files to the destination directory:\n\n   ```python\n   import shutil\n   import glob\n   \n   def data_staged(source_directory, destination):\n       files = glob.glob(source_directory + '/*')\n       for file_path in files:\n           shutil.copy(file_path, destination)\n   ```\n\nPlease note that the above code assumes that the source files and the destination directory already exist. If not, the appropriate checks and actions should be added to the code."
