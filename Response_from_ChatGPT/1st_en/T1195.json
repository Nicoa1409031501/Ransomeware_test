Method 1: Manipulating software dependencies\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionality: This method involves manipulating software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer.\n   \n2. Method 2: Manipulating application software\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionality: This method involves manipulating the source code, update/distribution mechanism, or compiled releases of the application software prior to receipt by a final consumer.\n\n3. Method 3: Manipulating hardware components\n   - Packages used: None\n   - Functionality: This method involves manipulating hardware or firmware in the supply chain to insert a backdoor into consumer networks for data or system compromise.\n\nNote: Since these methods involve hypothetical scenarios and would typically be part of a larger system, it is not possible to provide code examples for these specific techniques. Implementation would depend on the specific software or hardware being compromised."
