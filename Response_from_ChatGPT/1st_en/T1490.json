Method 1: Deleting Built-in Data\n\nimport os\n\ndef delete_built_in_data():\n    try:\n        # Delete built-in data or recovery files\n        os.remove('path_to_file')  # Replace 'path_to_file' with the actual path\n\n        # Additional steps to inhibit system recovery\n        # ...\n\n        print(\"Built-in data deleted successfully.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"File not found.\")\n\n2. Method 2: Turning off Services\n\nimport subprocess\n\ndef turn_off_services():\n    try:\n        # Turn off specific services\n        subprocess.call('net stop servicename', shell=True)  # Replace 'servicename' with the service name\n\n        # Additional steps to inhibit system recovery\n        # ...\n\n        print(\"Services turned off successfully.\")\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        print(\"Failed to turn off services.\")\n\n3. Method 3: Disabling Recovery Options\n\nimport winreg\n\ndef disable_recovery_options():\n    try:\n        # Disable recovery options by modifying registry\n        key = winreg.OpenKey(winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, 'path_to_key', 0, winreg.KEY_SET_VALUE)  # Replace 'path_to_key' with the actual key path\n        winreg.SetValueEx(key, 'RecoveryEnabled', 0, winreg.REG_DWORD, 0)\n\n        # Additional steps to inhibit system recovery\n        # ...\n\n        print(\"Recovery options disabled successfully.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"Registry key not found.\")\n    except PermissionError:\n        print(\"Insufficient privileges to modify the registry.\")\n\nNote: The code provided above demonstrates the implementation of various methods to inhibit system recovery. The actual paths, service names, and registry keys will vary based on the specific environment and requirements. Additionally, additional steps need to be added to fully inhibit the system recovery as mentioned in the description."
