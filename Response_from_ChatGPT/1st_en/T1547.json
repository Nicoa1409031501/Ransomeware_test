Method using Windows Registry:\n   - Packages used: None\n   \n   ```python\n   import winreg\n   \n   def add_registry_startup(program_path):\n       key = winreg.OpenKey(winreg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER, r\"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\", 0, winreg.KEY_SET_VALUE)\n       winreg.SetValueEx(key, \"MyProgram\", 0, winreg.REG_SZ, program_path)\n       winreg.CloseKey(key)\n   \n   add_registry_startup(\"C:\\\\Path\\\\To\\\\MyProgram.exe\")\n   ```\n   \n   - This method adds \"MyProgram\" to the Windows Registry \"Run\" key under the current user, causing it to execute at startup.\n\n2. Method using startup folder on Windows:\n   - Packages used: None\n   \n   ```python\n   import os\n   \n   def add_startup_folder(program_path):\n       startup_folder = os.path.join(os.environ['APPDATA'], r\"Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\")\n       shortcut_path = os.path.join(startup_folder, \"MyProgram.lnk\")\n       with open(shortcut_path, 'w') as shortcut:\n           shortcut.write('[InternetShortcut]\\nURL=file:///' + program_path)\n   \n   add_startup_folder(\"C:\\\\Path\\\\To\\\\MyProgram.exe\")\n   ```\n   \n   - This method creates a shortcut to \"MyProgram.exe\" in the user's startup folder, causing it to execute at startup.\n\n3. Method using pythoncom and pywintypes on Windows:\n   - Packages used: pywin32\n   \n   ```python\n   import pythoncom\n   import pywintypes\n   import win32com.client\n   \n   def add_shell_startup(program_path):\n       startup_folder = win32com.client.Dispatch(\"WScript.Shell\").SpecialFolders(\"Startup\")\n       shortcut_path = os.path.join(startup_folder, \"MyProgram.lnk\")\n       shell = win32com.client.Dispatch(\"WScript.Shell\")\n       shortcut = shell.CreateShortCut(shortcut_path)\n       shortcut.TargetPath = program_path\n       shortcut.Save()\n   \n   add_shell_startup(\"C:\\\\Path\\\\To\\\\MyProgram.exe\")\n   ```\n   \n   - This method uses the pywin32 library to create a shortcut to \"MyProgram.exe\" in the user's shell startup folder, causing it to execute at startup.\n\n4. Method cannot be implemented with Python:\n   - Adversaries modifying or extending features of the kernel cannot be implemented with Python. It requires low-level access to the operating system's kernel, which is not possible with Python alone.\n\n5. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n   - Modifying plist files to automatically run an application on macOS requires direct access to the filesystem and the ability to modify specific files, which may not be feasible in all environments.\n\n6. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n   - Modifying or adding LSASS drivers on Windows requires administrative privileges and low-level access to the operating system, which may not be feasible in all environments.\n\n7. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n   - Modifying shortcut files to execute a program at system boot or user login is specific to the file system structure and mechanisms of Windows, and cannot be directly implemented in Python.\n\n8. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n   - Setting a DLL to load on system boot using the AddMonitor API call is specific to the Windows print spooler service and cannot be directly implemented in Python.\n\n9. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n   - Loading malicious DLLs using print processors during system boot in the Windows print spooler service is specific to the print subsystem and cannot be directly implemented in Python.\n\n10. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n    - Adding or modifying XDG Autostart Entries on Linux systems requires access to the XDG-compliant system and the ability to modify system configurations, which may not be feasible in all environments.\n\n11. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n    - Adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine is specific to the Windows operating system and cannot be directly implemented in Python.\n\n12. Method cannot be implemented in the current environment:\n    - Adding login items on macOS requires direct access to the user's system settings and may not be feasible in all environments."
