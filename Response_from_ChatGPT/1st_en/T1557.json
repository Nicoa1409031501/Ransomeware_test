Method 1: Responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality:\n     - Spoof the authoritative source for name resolution\n     - Force communication with an adversary controlled system\n\n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n\ndef spoof_llmnr():\n    # Perform LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing here\n    pass\n\nspoof_llmnr()\n```\n\n2. Method 2: ARP cache poisoning\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality:\n     - Poison ARP caches to position the adversary as a man-in-the-middle\n     - Enable Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation\n\n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n\ndef arp_cache_poisoning():\n    # Perform ARP cache poisoning here\n    pass\n\narp_cache_poisoning()\n```\n\n3. Method 3: DHCP traffic spoofing\n   - Packages used: scapy\n   - Functionality:\n     - Spoof DHCP traffic and act as a malicious DHCP server\n     - Redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems\n     - Collect network communications, including passed credentials\n\n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\n\ndef dhcp_spoofing():\n    # Perform DHCP traffic spoofing here\n    pass\n\ndhcp_spoofing()\n```\n\nPlease note that the code provided in the examples is just a placeholder, and the actual implementation would require further development and customization based on the specific network environment and requirements."
