Method 1:\n   - Packages used: pyaudio, wave\n   - Functionality used: recording audio from the microphone\n   \n   ```python\n   import pyaudio\n   import wave\n   \n   def audio_capture(output_file, duration):\n       CHUNK = 1024\n       FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16\n       CHANNELS = 1\n       RATE = 44100\n       \n       p = pyaudio.PyAudio()\n       stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)\n       \n       frames = []\n       for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * duration)):\n           data = stream.read(CHUNK)\n           frames.append(data)\n       \n       stream.stop_stream()\n       stream.close()\n       p.terminate()\n       \n       wf = wave.open(output_file, 'wb')\n       wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)\n       wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT))\n       wf.setframerate(RATE)\n       wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))\n       wf.close()\n   ```\n   \n   File: audio_capture.py\n\n   Note: This implementation captures audio from the microphone and saves it to a specified output file for the duration specified in seconds.\n\n2. Method 2:\n   - Packages used: sounddevice\n   - Functionality used: recording audio from the microphone\n   \n   ```python\n   import sounddevice as sd\n   import soundfile as sf\n   \n   def audio_capture(output_file, duration):\n       fs = 44100  # Sample rate\n       seconds = duration  # Duration of recording\n   \n       myrecording = sd.rec(int(seconds * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=1)\n       sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished\n   \n       sf.write(output_file, myrecording, fs)\n   ```\n   \n   File: audio_capture.py\n\n   Note: This implementation also captures audio from the microphone and saves it to a specified output file for the duration specified in seconds.\n\n3. Method 3 (macOS and Linux only):\n   - Packages used: subprocess\n   - Functionality used: capturing audio using the `arecord` command-line tool\n   \n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n   \n   def audio_capture(output_file, duration):\n       sample_rate = 44100  # Sample rate\n       channels = 1  # Channels (mono)\n       \n       subprocess.run(['arecord', '-d', str(duration), '-r', str(sample_rate), '-c', str(channels), '-f', 'S16_LE', output_file])\n   ```\n   \n   File: audio_capture.py\n\n   Note: This implementation uses the `arecord` command-line tool, which is typically available on macOS and Linux systems, to capture audio and save it to a specified output file for the duration specified in seconds."
